Question: How many products does the brand Shibolim have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many products does the brand Shibolim have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of products (items) that belong to the brand "Shibolim". First, I need to find the brand node for Shibolim in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Shibolim]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_479.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node ID (brand_479), I need to find out how many products (items) this brand has. Since brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, I should check the number of item neighbors for this brand node.
Action 2: NodeDegree[brand_479, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbor node degree of brand_479 are: 1. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The NodeDegree function returned that brand_479 has 1 item neighbor. However, the question asks for the number of products (items) and specifically requests to provide node main features (names) rather than node IDs. I should verify this by listing the actual item neighbors to confirm there's only one product and to get its name.
Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_479, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_479 are: ['B00007B9L0']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have the item node ID 'B00007B9L0' for the product from Shibolim. To provide the main feature (name) as requested, I need to get the title of this item node.
Action 4: NodeFeature[B00007B9L0, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00007B9L0 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than a readable product name. This might be an issue with the data. Let me try to get other features of this item to see if I can find a proper product name. I should check if there's a description or category that might contain the product name.
Action 5: NodeFeature[B00007B9L0, description]
Observation 5: The description feature of B00007B9L0 are: ["Founded in 1976, Parabola is devoted to the exploration of the myths, symbols, rituals, and art of the world's religious and cultural traditions. Every issue explores one of the facets of human existence from the point of view of many world religions and spiritual traditions with essays and images."]. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The description doesn't provide a clear product name either. Let me try checking the category feature to see if that gives more information about the product.
Action 6: NodeFeature[B00007B9L0, category]
Observation 6: The category feature of B00007B9L0 are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The category feature is empty. Let me try to get the title feature again, but perhaps I need to parse the HTML to extract the actual product name. Alternatively, I should check if there's a mistake in the node retrieval or if I need to look at the raw title content more carefully.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00007B9L0, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B00007B9L0 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The title feature appears to be incomplete HTML code. This suggests that the actual product name might be embedded within this HTML. However, since the question asks for the main feature (name) of the product, and the NodeFeature function is returning raw HTML, I should interpret this as the product name being "Parabola Magazine" or similar based on the description. But to be precise, let me check if there are any other item neighbors for this brand, as the NodeDegree initially indicated only one product.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[brand_479, item]
Observation 8: The item neighbors of brand_479 are: ['B00007B9L0']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The NeighbourCheck confirms there is only one item node (B00007B9L0) linked to brand_479. Since the title feature appears to be incomplete HTML, but the description mentions "Parabola" magazine, I should use that as the product name. The brand Shibolim has 1 product, which is "Parabola Magazine" based on the description.
Action 9: Finish[1, Parabola Magazine]
Observation 9: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 3
