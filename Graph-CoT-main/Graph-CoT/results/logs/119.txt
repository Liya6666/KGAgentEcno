Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with a specific item. The item is given with an unusual identifier that appears to be HTML code: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?". This might be a formatting issue or the actual title. I need to first retrieve this item node.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the node ID for the target item. The question asks which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with this item. "Co-viewed items" likely refers to items that are both viewed together, meaning they share common "also_viewed_item" neighbors. I need to find items that have a significant overlap in their also_viewed_item sets with the target item.
Action 2: Thought 2: To find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with the target item, I need to first identify the also_viewed_item neighbors of the target item. Then, for each of those neighbors, I can check which other items also have them as also_viewed_item neighbors. This will help me find items that share common also_viewed_item neighbors with the target.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to first get the also_viewed_item neighbors of the target item B00005N7NQ to understand what items are co-viewed with it.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now I have the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for the target item. To find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with the target, I need to check for each of these neighbor items, which other items also have them as also_viewed_item neighbors. However, this approach might be inefficient. A better way is to check the also_viewed_item neighbors of the target item and then for each of those neighbors, check their also_viewed_item neighbors to find items that appear frequently across multiple neighbor sets.
Action 4: Thought 4: Actually, I need to reconsider the approach. The question asks for items that share over 4 co-viewed items with the target item. This means I need to find items that have more than 4 common "also_viewed_item" neighbors with the target item B00005N7NQ.
Observation 4: 
Thought 5: Thought 5: I need to find items that share more than 4 common "also_viewed_item" neighbors with the target item B00005N7NQ. To do this efficiently, I should:
Action 5: Thought 5: I need to find items that share more than 4 common "also_viewed_item" neighbors with the target item B00005N7NQ. To do this efficiently, I should first get the set of also_viewed_item neighbors for the target item, then for each of these neighbor items, check their also_viewed_item neighbors to build a frequency count of which items appear most frequently across these neighbor sets.
Observation 5: 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I need to find items that share more than 4 common "also_viewed_item" neighbors with the target item B00005N7NQ. Let me first get the set of also_viewed_item neighbors for the target item (which I already have from Observation 3). Then, for each of these neighbor items, I'll check their also_viewed_item neighbors to find items that appear frequently across these sets.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 6: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I have the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for the target item. Now I need to find items that share more than 4 of these neighbors with the target. To do this, I should check the also_viewed_item neighbors of each of these neighbor items to build a frequency count of which items appear across multiple neighbor sets. However, this might be computationally intensive. A more efficient approach might be to check items that are directly connected to these neighbors through also_viewed_item relationships.
Action 7: Thought 7: I need to find items that share more than 4 common "also_viewed_item" neighbors with the target item. Let me start by selecting one of the also_viewed_item neighbors of the target item and check its also_viewed_item neighbors to see which items appear in multiple neighbor sets.
Observation 7: 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I need to systematically find items that share more than 4 common "also_viewed_item" neighbors with the target item B00005N7NQ. Let me start by taking the first few also_viewed_item neighbors from the list and check their also_viewed_item neighbors to build a frequency count of items that appear across multiple neighbor sets.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[B000UHI2LW, also_viewed_item]
Observation 8: The node or neighbor type does not exist in the graph. This might because your given neighbor type is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The neighbor type "also_viewed_item" might not be correct for the neighbor node B000UHI2LW. Let me check what types of neighbors this node has by trying different neighbor types or checking if it's an item node.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 9: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 10: Thought 10: It seems B000UHI2LW might not be an item node, or there might be an issue with the node ID. Let me first verify that the target item node B00005N7NQ is correctly retrieved and check its features to ensure it's a valid item node.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 11: Thought 11: Now I understand - the target item's title is actually "<span class=\"a-size-medium a-color-secondary\"", which explains why the question had that unusual identifier. The node is valid. Now I need to find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with this target item. Let me try a different approach. Instead of checking the also_viewed_item neighbors of the target's also_viewed_item neighbors, I should look for items that are connected to the target through multiple also_viewed_item relationships. Perhaps I should check the also_viewed_item neighbors of the target item and see which other items have many of these same items in their also_viewed_item lists.
Action 11: Thought 11: I need to find items that share more than 4 common "also_viewed_item" neighbors with the target item B00005N7NQ. Let me try a different approach. I should get the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for the target item, then for each item in the graph that has also_viewed_item relationships, check how many of those neighbors they share with the target item. However, since I can't iterate through all items in the graph, I should focus on items that are likely to share many co-viewed items, such as items in the same category or from the same brand.
Observation 11: 
Thought 12: Thought 12: Since I cannot iterate through all items in the graph, I need a more targeted approach. I should first check the brand and category of the target item to find related items that might share similar viewing patterns. Then I can check their also_viewed_item neighbors to find overlaps with the target's also_viewed_item neighbors.
Action 12: Thought 12: I should first get the brand and category of the target item to find related items that might share similar viewing patterns. This will help me narrow down the search space for items that could potentially share many co-viewed items with the target.
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I need to find the brand and category of the target item to identify related items that might share similar viewing patterns. This will help me narrow down the search for items that could share many co-viewed items with the target.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 13: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 14: Thought 14: The "brand" feature might not be directly available as a feature of the item node. Instead, brand information is likely stored as a relationship to a brand node. I should check the brand neighbors of the target item.
Action 14: Action 14: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 14: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: Now I have the brand node ID for the target item. Let me get the brand name to better understand what type of product this is.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 15: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine.
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
