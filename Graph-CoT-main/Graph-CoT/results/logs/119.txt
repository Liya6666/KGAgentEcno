Question: What is the quantity of items sharing the same purchased-together items as item Nokia CC-3068 Shell for Lumia 520 - Retail Packaging - White?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the quantity of items sharing the same purchased-together items as item Nokia CC-3068 Shell for Lumia 520 - Retail Packaging - White? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items that share the same purchased-together items as a specific item (Nokia CC-3068 Shell for Lumia 520 - Retail Packaging - White). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Nokia CC-3068 Shell for Lumia 520 - Retail Packaging - White]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_528" as the ID, but this seems incorrect because the question is about an item, not a brand. I should double-check the retrieval. Perhaps the exact title needs to be adjusted, or there might be a mistake in the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the node again with a slightly different query, focusing on the key terms.
Action 2: Action 2: RetrieveNode[Nokia CC-3068 Shell for Lumia 520 White]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007GAMH.
Thought 3: Thought 3: Good, now I have the correct item node ID: B00007GAMH. The question is about items that share the same purchased-together items as this item. First, I need to find the purchased-together items for this Nokia item.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00007GAMH, bought_together_item]
Observation 3: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00007GAMH are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The observation shows that the Nokia item has no bought_together_item neighbors. This means there are no items that are typically purchased together with it. Therefore, the set of items sharing the same purchased-together items would be empty, or perhaps just the item itself if we consider an empty set as shared. However, the question asks for the quantity of items sharing the same purchased-together items. Since the bought_together_item list is empty, only the Nokia item itself has this empty set of purchased-together items. But let me confirm if there are any other items that also have an empty bought_together_item list. However, the question is specifically about sharing the same purchased-together items as the Nokia item, which is an empty set. So, the quantity should be 1 (only itself) if no other items have an empty bought_together_item list, or more if there are others. But typically, we are to find items that have exactly the same set of bought_together_item neighbors. Since the set is empty, we need to find all items that also have an empty bought_together_item list. However, this might be inefficient to check for all items. Alternatively, perhaps the graph has no bought_together_item links for this item, but it might have other types of links. But the question is specifically about bought_together_item. Given that the list is empty, the items sharing the same (empty) set are those with no bought_t
Action 4: Thought 4: Since the Nokia item has an empty bought_together_item list, I need to find all items that also have an empty bought_together_item list. However, checking every item in the graph for this property would be inefficient. Instead, I should consider if there's a better way. Perhaps the graph structure allows me to find items with no bought_together_item neighbors directly, but the available functions don't support that directly. Alternatively, I might misinterpret the question. The question asks for items sharing the same purchased-together items, which for the Nokia item is an empty set. So, only items with identical (empty) bought_together_item sets would qualify. But to be thorough, let me first confirm if the Nokia item indeed has no bought_together_item neighbors by checking its degree.
Observation 4: 
Thought 5: Thought 5: Let me first confirm that the Nokia item has no bought_together_item neighbors by checking its degree for that neighbor type.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeDegree[B00007GAMH, bought_together_item]
Observation 5: The bought_together_item neighbor node degree of B00007GAMH are: 0. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The degree is 0, confirming that the Nokia item has no bought_together_item neighbors. Now, to find items that share the same purchased-together items (i.e., also have an empty bought_together_item list), I need to identify all items with a bought_together_item degree of 0. However, the available functions do not directly allow querying all nodes with a specific degree.
Action 6: Thought 6: Since I cannot directly query all items with bought_together_item degree 0, I need to consider an alternative approach. The question is about items sharing the same purchased-together items, which for this Nokia item is an empty set. However, in the context of the graph, it's possible that many items have no bought_together_item neighbors. But without a way to query all such items, I might need to reconsider. Perhaps the observation that the Nokia item has no bought_together_item neighbors means that there are no items that share the same purchased-together items in the sense of having an identical non-empty set, but since the set is empty, it might be just itself. However, the question asks for "quantity of items sharing the same purchased-together items", which could include the item itself. Given the constraints, the most straightforward answer is that only the Nokia item itself has this empty set, so the quantity is 1. But to be precise, let me check if the graph has any general information about items with no bought_together_item, but since I can't, I'll proceed with this reasoning.
Observation 6: 
Thought 7: Thought 7: Given that the Nokia item has no bought_together_item neighbors (degree 0), items sharing the same purchased-together items must also have an empty bought_together_item set. However, without a direct way to query all such items, I should consider if the question might be interpreted differently. Perhaps "sharing the same purchased-together items" means items that have at least one bought_together_item in common, but for an empty set, this is not applicable. Since the set is empty, only items with identical empty sets qualify. Given the graph functions' limitations, I can only infer that the Nokia item itself is the only one with this property, as I cannot verify others. Thus, the quantity is likely 1.
Action 7: Action 7: Finish[1]
Observation 7: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 48
