Question: How many items are in brand S-TECH?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items are in brand S-TECH? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the number of items in brand S-TECH. First, I need to find the brand node for S-TECH. Since brand nodes have a "name" feature, I should search for the brand node with name "S-TECH".
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[S-TECH]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_771.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node ID (brand_771), I need to find how many items are linked to this brand. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, so I should check the number of item neighbors for this brand node.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[brand_771, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbor node degree of brand_771 are: 1. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The NodeDegree function returned 1, indicating that brand_771 has 1 item neighbor. However, the question asks for the number of items in brand S-TECH, and I should provide the answer based on this information. But let me double-check by listing the actual item neighbors to ensure accuracy.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_771, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_771 are: ['B001GDJ4OS']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have confirmed that brand_771 (S-TECH) has one item neighbor with ID 'B001GDJ4OS'. The question asks for the number of items, which is 1. However, the instruction says to answer by providing node main features (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. So I should retrieve the title of this item to present the answer properly.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B001GDJ4OS, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B001GDJ4OS are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than a proper product title. This might be an issue with the data. However, the question is asking for the number of items, not their specific titles. Since I've confirmed there is exactly 1 item linked to brand S-TECH, I should provide the count. The instruction about providing node main features seems to be for cases where specific items need to be identified, but here we just need the count.
Action 5: Action 5: Finish[1]
Observation 5: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 1
