Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"']?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"']? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a next item recommendation based on a user's history. However, the history provided appears to be a list of HTML span tags with classes, not actual item titles or node identifiers. I need to interpret what these tags represent. Perhaps they are placeholders or a specific formatting for item titles in the graph's data. I should try to retrieve nodes using these strings as they are, as they might be part of the title or description features.

Action 2: Thought 1: The user's history appears to be a list of HTML span tags rather than actual item titles. This seems unusual - these might be formatting elements from item descriptions or titles. I should try to retrieve nodes using these strings as keywords, as they might match parts of item features.
