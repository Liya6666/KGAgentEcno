Question: How much does the item Chicago Pneumatic SS3113D 3/8&quot; Drive 13 Piece Metric Deep Impact Socket Set cost?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How much does the item Chicago Pneumatic SS3113D 3/8&quot; Drive 13 Piece Metric Deep Impact Socket Set cost? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of a specific item. I need to first find the node for this item in the graph using its title.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Chicago Pneumatic SS3113D 3/8" Drive 13 Piece Metric Deep Impact Socket Set]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_553.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_553" as the node ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should verify if this is indeed the correct node by checking its features to confirm it's an item node.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_553, name]
Observation 2: The name feature of brand_553 are: Accident Reconstruction Jrnl. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The node retrieved as "brand_553" has the name "Accident Reconstruction Jrnl", which is clearly not the item I'm looking for. This indicates that the initial retrieval may have failed to find the correct item node. I should try to retrieve the node again with a more specific or slightly different query, perhaps focusing on key unique identifiers from the item title like the model number "SS3113D".
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[SS3113D]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval using "SS3113D" returned another brand node (brand_411), which is not what we want. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with these keywords, or I need to try a different approach. Since the question is about an item's price, I should look for the item by its full title but perhaps with proper encoding for special characters like the quotation mark. The original title has "3/8&quot;" which might be HTML-encoded for the inch symbol. I should try retrieving with the proper symbol or a simplified version.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Chicago Pneumatic SS3113D 3/8" Drive 13 Piece Metric Deep Impact Socket Set]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_553.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval is consistently returning brand nodes instead of the item node I need. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with the exact title, or there might be an issue with how the graph is structured. I should try to retrieve the node using a different approach - perhaps by searching for a partial match or a key unique part of the title that might be more likely to match an item node. Let me try using just "Chicago Pneumatic SS3113D" as the keyword.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Chicago Pneumatic SS3113D]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_211.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of the item node I need. This suggests that the exact item title might not be directly retrievable, or there might be an issue with special characters. Let me try a different approach - perhaps the item exists but with a slightly different title in the graph. I should try retrieving with just the model number "SS3113D" but specify that I'm looking for an item node. Since the retrieval function doesn't allow specifying node type, I need to find another way. Let me try searching for "Chicago Pneumatic" items first, then look for the specific model.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Chicago Pneumatic]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_38.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Chicago Pneumatic". This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand nodes over item nodes when there are matches. Let me try a different approach - since I know the brand is "Chicago Pneumatic", I can first get the brand node, then look at its item neighbors to find the specific item with model SS3113D.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[brand_38, name]
Observation 7: The name feature of brand_38 are: Chicago. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The brand node "brand_38" has name "Chicago", which doesn't match "Chicago Pneumatic". This suggests I need to find the correct brand node first. Let me try retrieving "Chicago Pneumatic" again but be more specific, or try to find the brand node that actually represents Chicago Pneumatic.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Chicago Pneumatic]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_38.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm consistently getting brand nodes that don't match what I'm looking for. Let me try a different approach - perhaps the brand name is stored differently in the graph. I should try searching for "Pneumatic" to see if that helps identify the correct brand node.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Pneumatic]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_139.
Thought 10: Thought 10: This approach isn't working well. I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of the item I need. Let me try a different strategy - perhaps the item title contains special characters that need to be handled differently. The original title has "3/8&quot;" which represents 3/8 inch. Let me try retrieving with the actual inch symbol or a simplified version without the special characters.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Chicago Pneumatic SS3113D 3/8 inch Drive 13 Piece Metric Deep Impact Socket Set]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_553.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of the item node. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with the exact title. Let me try a different approach - perhaps search for just "SS3113D" and then check if any of the results are item nodes with the correct features. Since RetrieveNode seems to be returning brand nodes, I should try to find the item by checking the features of nodes that might be related.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[SS3113D Socket]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007B0M3.
Thought 12: Thought 12: Great! Now I got a node ID "B00007B0M3" which looks like an item node ID (not a brand node). I should verify this is the correct item by checking its title feature to confirm it matches the item I'm looking for.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00007B0M3, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B00007B0M3 are: Plugged in. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The title "Plugged in" doesn't match the item I'm looking for. This suggests that the node B00007B0M3 might not be the correct item. I need to continue searching for the specific Chicago Pneumatic socket set. Let me try a different approach - perhaps search for "Chicago Pneumatic Socket Set" to find relevant items.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Chicago Pneumatic Socket Set]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_799.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. This suggests that the exact item title might not be directly retrievable. Let me try a different approach - search for "Chicago Pneumatic" to get the brand node, then check all its item neighbors to find the specific socket set with model SS3113D.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Chicago Pneumatic]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_38.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm consistently getting brand_38 when searching for "Chicago Pneumatic", but earlier I saw that brand_38 has the name "Chicago" which doesn't match. Let me first verify what brand_38 actually represents by checking its name feature, then look at its item neighbors to see if any match the socket set I'm looking for.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[brand_38, name]
Observation 15: The name feature of brand_38 are: Chicago.
Correct answer: 28.66
