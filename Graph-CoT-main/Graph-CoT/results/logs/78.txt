Question: What is the total number of items for the brand Family Maid?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the total number of items for the brand Family Maid? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the total number of items for the brand "Family Maid". First, I need to find the brand node for "Family Maid" in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Family Maid]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_556.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node ID (brand_556), I need to find out how many items are linked to this brand. Since brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, I should check the number of item neighbors for this brand node.
Action 2: NodeDegree[brand_556, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbor node degree of brand_556 are: 1. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The NodeDegree function returned 1, indicating that brand_556 (Family Maid) has 1 item neighbor. However, I should verify this by checking the actual item neighbors to ensure accuracy.
Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_556, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_556 are: ['B00008RUG1']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have confirmed that brand_556 (Family Maid) has exactly 1 item neighbor with ID 'B00008RUG1'. The question asks for the total number of items, which is 1. Since the question specifies to provide node main features rather than IDs, I should get the title of this item to present the answer in the requested format.
Action 4: NodeFeature[B00008RUG1, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00008RUG1 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature returned appears to be HTML code rather than a readable product title. This suggests there might be an issue with the data. However, the question is asking for the total number of items, not the specific item titles. Since I've confirmed there is exactly 1 item linked to the Family Maid brand, I should provide the count as the answer.
Action 5: Finish[1]
Observation 5: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 5
