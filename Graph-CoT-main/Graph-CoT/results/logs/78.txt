Question: What is the main category of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the main category of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the main category of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted with HTML tags. I need to first identify the correct item node. The title seems to start with "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?" which looks like an HTML fragment rather than a proper item title. I should try to retrieve the node using the visible text portion if possible.
Action 1: Thought 1: The item title appears to be corrupted with HTML tags. The visible portion seems to be missing or unclear. I should try to retrieve the node using the text that appears after the HTML tag, but the question mark suggests the title might be incomplete. Let me try to retrieve the node with the available text.
