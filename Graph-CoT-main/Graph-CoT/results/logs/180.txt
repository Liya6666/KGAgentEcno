Question: What is the alternative item proposed for this particular query: vegan protein powder?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the alternative item proposed for this particular query: vegan protein powder? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for alternative items proposed for the query "vegan protein powder". This seems different from previous examples where we started with a specific item node. I need to first find item nodes related to "vegan protein powder" in the graph.

Thought 2: Thought 1: The question is asking for alternative items proposed for the query "vegan protein powder". I need to first find item nodes related to this query. Since the graph doesn't have a direct "query" node type, I should search for items that match this query by their features (like title or description containing "vegan protein powder").
Action 2: Thought 2: I need to find items related to "vegan protein powder". Since there's no direct query node, I should search for items with features matching this query. I'll use RetrieveNode with "vegan protein powder" to find relevant item nodes.

Since the graph doesn't have query nodes, I should search for items whose features (like title, description, or category) contain "vegan protein powder". However, the RetrieveNode function seems to work with exact node names/titles. I should try to find items that match this query.

Thought 7: Thought 1: The question is asking for alternative items proposed for the query "vegan protein powder". This is different from previous examples as it starts with a query rather than a specific item. I need to first find item nodes related to this query. Since the graph doesn't have query nodes, I should search for items whose titles or descriptions contain "vegan protein powder" using RetrieveNode.
Action 7: Action 1: RetrieveNode[vegan protein powder]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_911.
Thought 8: Thought 8: Interesting, the RetrieveNode function returned a brand node (brand_911) instead of an item node when searching for "vegan protein powder". This suggests that "vegan protein powder" might be a brand name rather than a product query. Since the question asks for alternative items proposed for this query, I should explore items associated with this brand.
Action 8: Thought 8: Since "vegan protein powder" returned a brand node (brand_911), I should explore items associated with this brand to find relevant products. Then I can look for alternative items through the various relationship types (also_viewed, also_bought, etc.).
Observation 8: 
Thought 9: Thought 9: Now that I know "vegan protein powder" corresponds to brand_911, I should find the items associated with this brand to identify the main products. Then I can look for alternative items through relationship types like also_viewed_item or also_bought_item.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[brand_911, item]
Observation 9: The item neighbors of brand_911 are: ['B00KKUXLVK']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I found that brand_911 has one associated item: B00KKUXLVK. Now I need to find alternative items for this product. I should check the various relationship types like also_viewed_item, also_bought_item, etc. to find alternative items. Since the question asks for alternative items proposed for the query "vegan protein powder", I should look at the relationships of this main item.
Action 10: Action 10: NeighbourCheck[B00KKUXLVK, also_viewed_item]
Observation 10: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00KKUXLVK are: []. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The also_viewed_item neighbors returned an empty list. I should try other relationship types to find alternative items. Let me check also_bought_item, buy_after_viewing_item, and bought_together_item relationships.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[B00KKUXLVK, also_bought_item]
Observation 11: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00KKUXLVK are: []. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The also_bought_item neighbors also returned an empty list. I should try the remaining relationship types to find alternative items. Let me check buy_after_viewing_item and bought_together_item relationships.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[B00KKUXLVK, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 12: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00KKUXLVK are: []. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: All the relationship checks for alternative items (also_viewed_item, also_bought_item, buy_after_viewing_item) have returned empty lists. I should try the remaining relationship type: bought_together_item. If that also returns empty, I may need to reconsider my approach or check if there are other items related to "vegan protein powder".
Action 13: Action 13: NeighbourCheck[B00KKUXLVK, bought_together_item]
Observation 13: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00KKUXLVK are: []. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: All relationship checks for alternative items returned empty lists. This suggests that either the item B00KKUXLVK has no recorded alternative items in the graph, or I need to reconsider my approach. Since the question asks for alternative items proposed for the query "vegan protein powder", and I found only one item associated with the brand, perhaps I should look for other items that might be related to vegan protein powder through their features. Let me first check the features of the item I found to confirm it's actually a vegan protein powder product.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00KKUXLVK, title]
Observation 14: The title feature of B00KKUXLVK are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The title feature returned HTML code instead of a readable product title. This suggests there might be an issue with how I'm approaching this. Let me check other features of this item to better understand what it is, and also reconsider my initial approach. Since "vegan protein powder" returned a brand node, perhaps I should search for items with "vegan protein powder" in their features more directly.
Action 15: Thought 15: The title feature returned HTML code, which is unusual. Let me check the description and category features of this item to better understand what it is. Also, I should reconsider my approach - perhaps I need to search for items that contain "vegan protein powder" in their features more directly, rather than relying on the brand association.
