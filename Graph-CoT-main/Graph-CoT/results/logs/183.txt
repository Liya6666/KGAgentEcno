Question: What is the substitutive item given this query: monks of weston priory winters coming home?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the substitutive item given this query: monks of weston priory winters coming home? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a "substitutive item" related to the query "monks of weston priory winters coming home". This seems to be looking for alternative or similar items. In e-commerce graphs, substitutive items are typically connected through relationships like "also_viewed_item", "also_bought_item", or "bought_together_item". First, I need to find the item node corresponding to this query.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[monks of weston priory winters coming home]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_174.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The retrieval returned a brand node (brand_174) instead of an item node. The query "monks of weston priory winters coming home" likely refers to a specific product (item), but it was matched to a brand. I should try to find the specific item node by using the brand node to list its connected items, then identify the correct one based on the query details.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_174, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_174 are: ['B00006K88Z']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: Now I have an item node ID 'B00006K88Z' that belongs to brand_174. I should check this item's title to confirm it matches the query "monks of weston priory winters coming home".
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00006K88Z, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00006K88Z are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than the actual title text. This might be an issue with how the feature is stored. Let me try to get the description or other features to better identify this item.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00006K88Z, description]
Observation 4: The description feature of B00006K88Z are: ['An ecumenical worship resource.']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The description "An ecumenical worship resource" suggests this might be related to the query about monks and Weston Priory. However, I need to confirm if this is indeed the correct item for "winters coming home". Since the question asks for a "substitutive item", I should look for alternative items connected through relationships like "also_viewed_item" or "also_bought_item". Let me first check what relationships this item has.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00006K88Z, also_viewed_item]
Observation 5: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00006K88Z are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The item has no also_viewed_item neighbors. Let me check other relationship types that might provide substitutive items, such as also_bought_item or bought_together_item.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00006K88Z, also_bought_item]
Observation 6: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00006K88Z are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The item has no also_bought_item neighbors either. Let me check the bought_together_item relationship, which is another common type for finding substitutive items.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[B00006K88Z, bought_together_item]
Observation 7: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00006K88Z are: []. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: It appears this item has no direct substitutive relationships (also_viewed, also_bought, or bought_together). Since the question specifically asks for a "substitutive item", I should consider alternative approaches. Perhaps I need to look at other items from the same brand that might serve as substitutes, or check if there are items in the same category. Let me first check the category of this item to find similar items.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00006K88Z, category]
Observation 8: The category feature of B00006K88Z are: []. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The category feature is empty. Since direct substitutive relationships are not available, I should try to find other items from the same brand that might serve as substitutes. Let me check what other items are linked to brand_174.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[brand_174, item]
Observation 9: The item neighbors of brand_174 are: ['B00006K88Z']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The brand_174 only has one item ('B00006K88Z') associated with it. Since there are no other items from the same brand and no direct substitutive relationships, I need to consider alternative approaches. Perhaps I should check if there are items with similar titles or descriptions that could serve as substitutes. Let me try to search for items related to "monks" or "weston priory" or "winters coming home" to find potential substitutes.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[monks weston priory winters coming home]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_417.
Thought 11: Thought 11: The retrieval returned another brand node (brand_417) instead of an item. This suggests that "monks of weston priory winters coming home" might be a brand name rather than a specific item title. Since the question asks for a "substitutive item", I should look for items from this brand that could serve as substitutes. Let me check what items are associated with brand_417.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[brand_417, item]
Observation 11: The item neighbors of brand_417 are: ['B000071FIM']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I now have another item node 'B000071FIM' from brand_417. Since the question asks for a "substitutive item" for the query "monks of weston priory winters coming home", and this appears to be a brand-related query, I should check if this item could serve as a substitute. Let me first examine this item's features to understand what it is.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B000071FIM, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B000071FIM are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The title feature is again returning HTML code rather than readable text. Let me try to get the description feature to better understand what this item is about.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B000071FIM, description]
Observation 13: The description feature of B000071FIM are: ['Scholarly journal containing research articles, review and fellowship notes.']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The description "Scholarly journal containing research articles, review and fellowship notes" doesn't seem directly related to "monks of weston priory winters coming home". Since I'm having difficulty finding substitutive items through direct relationships, and the query appears to be brand-related rather than a specific item, I should consider that the question might be asking for an alternative item from the same brand or in the same category. Let me check if there are any other brands with similar names that might have substitutive items.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[weston priory]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_121.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I've retrieved another brand node (brand_121) related to "weston priory". Let me check what items are associated with this brand to find potential substitutive items.
Action 15: Action 15: NeighbourCheck[brand_121, item]
Observation 15: The item neighbors of brand_121 are: ['B000063XJR', 'B000063XJH', 'B000063XJI', 'B000063XJP', 'B000IJ885W'].
