Question: How many items are in brand Eye to Eye Media Ltd?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items are in brand Eye to Eye Media Ltd? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking how many items belong to the brand "Eye to Eye Media Ltd". First, I need to find the brand node in the graph using its name.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[Eye to Eye Media Ltd]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_610.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node ID, I need to find how many items are linked to this brand. Since brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, I should check the degree of the brand node with respect to its item neighbors.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[brand_610, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbor node degree of brand_610 are: 1. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The NodeDegree function returned 1, indicating that brand_610 has 1 item neighbor. However, the question asks for the number of items in the brand, and specifically requests to provide node main features (names) rather than node IDs. So I should list the actual item(s) to confirm and provide their names.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_610, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_610 are: ['B000225SRG']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have the item node ID 'B000225SRG'. Now I need to get the main feature (title) of this item to provide the answer with the item name rather than just the count or ID.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B000225SRG, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B000225SRG are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature returned appears to be HTML code rather than the actual product title. This might be an issue with the data. Let me try to retrieve the item node using its ID to get the proper title, or check if there are other features that might contain the name.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[B000225SRG]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 6: Thought 6: There seems to be confusion in the graph data. When I tried to retrieve the item node by its ID 'B000225SRG', it returned a brand node ID 'brand_411' instead. This suggests that 'B000225SRG' might actually be a brand node, not an item node. Let me verify the node type by checking its features.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B000225SRG, name]
Observation 6: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The node 'B000225SRG' might not be an item node since it doesn't have a 'name' feature (brands have 'name' feature, items have 'title'). Let me try checking if it has item features like 'title'.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B000225SRG, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B000225SRG are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The title feature still returns HTML code, which is not helpful. Let me try to retrieve the brand node "Eye to Eye Media Ltd" again and verify its connections. Perhaps there's an error in the graph data or my approach.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Eye to Eye Media Ltd]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_610.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I need to verify the connections of brand_610 more carefully. Let me check what type of neighbors this brand node has and ensure I'm using the correct neighbor type.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[brand_610, item]
Observation 9: The item neighbors of brand_610 are: ['B000225SRG']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The graph consistently shows that brand_610 has one item neighbor with ID 'B000225SRG'. However, when I try to get the title of this item, I get HTML code instead of a proper product name. Let me try to check if this node has other features that might contain the actual product name, such as 'description' or 'category'.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B000225SRG, description]
Observation 10: The description feature of B000225SRG are: ['<i>Delicious</i> celebrates food and the people who produce it, from celebrity chefs to passionate epicureans from around Australia and the rest of the world. Issues include a wide variety of recipes, tips and techniques, product reviews, gardening features for those who want to include homegrown ingredients, and more.', '', '']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The description feature provides meaningful text about a product called "Delicious" magazine. This confirms that B000225SRG is indeed an item node. The title feature seems to have HTML formatting issues, but the description clearly identifies the product. Since the question asks for node main features (names) rather than node IDs, I should use the product name from the description. The description mentions "Delicious" magazine, which appears to be the main product name.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B000225SRG, category]
Observation 11: The category feature of B000225SRG are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional &amp; Educational Journals', 'Professional &amp; Trade', 'Humanities &amp; Social Sciences', 'Economics &amp; Economic Theory']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The category feature confirms this is a magazine subscription product. Based on the description, the main product name appears to be "Delicious" magazine. Since the question asks for the number of items in the brand and to provide node main features (names) rather than node IDs, I should state that there is 1 item: "Delicious" magazine.
Action 12: Thought 12: I have determined that brand "Eye to Eye Media Ltd" (brand_610) has 1 item neighbor with ID B000225SRG. The item's description identifies it as "Delicious" magazine. Since the question asks for the number of items and to provide node main features (names), I should answer with the count and the item name.
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Action 12: Finish[1 item: Delicious magazine]
Action 13: Thought 1: The question is asking how many items belong to the brand "Eye to Eye Media Ltd" and requests to provide the answer using node main features (names) rather than node IDs. First, I need to find the brand node in the graph.
Observation 13: 
Thought 14: Thought 1: The question is asking how many items belong to the brand "Eye to Eye Media Ltd" and requests to provide the answer using node main features (names) rather than node IDs. First, I need to find the brand node in the graph.
Action 14: Action 1: RetrieveNode[Eye to Eye Media Ltd]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_610.
Thought 15: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node ID, I need to find how many items are linked to this brand. I should check the degree of the brand node with respect to its item neighbors.
Action 15: Action 2: NodeDegree[brand_610, item]
Observation 15: The item neighbor node degree of brand_610 are: 1.
Correct answer: 1
