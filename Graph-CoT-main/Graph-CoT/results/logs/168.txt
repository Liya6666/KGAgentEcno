Question: What is the network centrality score of item Woman's Day based on its total connections?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the network centrality score of item Woman's Day based on its total connections? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the network centrality score of an item node called "Woman's Day" based on its total connections. First, I need to find the item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Woman's Day]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7TM.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the node ID for "Woman's Day". The question asks for the network centrality score based on total connections. In graph theory, centrality based on total connections typically refers to degree centrality, which is simply the total number of connections a node has. I need to calculate the total degree of this node, which would include all types of connections: brand, also_viewed_item, buy_after_viewing_item, also_bought_item, and bought_together_item.
Action 2: Thought 2: To calculate the total degree centrality, I need to sum up all connections from this item node. This includes connections to brand, also_viewed_item, buy_after_viewing_item, also_bought_item, and bought_together_item. I should calculate each type separately and then sum them.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to calculate the total degree of node B00005N7TM by summing up its connections across all neighbor types. I'll use NodeDegree for each relationship type and then sum them.
Action 3: Thought 3: I need to calculate the total degree of node B00005N7TM by summing up its connections across all neighbor types. I'll use NodeDegree for each relationship type and then sum them.
Observation 3: 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I need to calculate the degree for each relationship type separately. Let me start by checking the degree for brand connections.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeDegree[B00005N7TM, brand]
Observation 4: The brand neighbor node degree of B00005N7TM are: 0. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The brand degree is 0. Now I need to check the degree for also_viewed_item connections.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeDegree[B00005N7TM, also_viewed_item]
Observation 5: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7TM are: 2. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I need to continue checking the remaining relationship types. Next, I'll check the buy_after_viewing_item connections.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeDegree[B00005N7TM, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 6: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7TM are: 0. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I need to continue checking the remaining relationship types. Next, I'll check the also_bought_item connections.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeDegree[B00005N7TM, also_bought_item]
Observation 7: The also_bought_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7TM are: 0. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I need to check the final relationship type: bought_together_item connections.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeDegree[B00005N7TM, bought_together_item]
Observation 8: The bought_together_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7TM are: 0. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: Now I have all the degree information. The total degree centrality is the sum of all these connections: brand (0) + also_viewed_item (2) + buy_after_viewing_item (0) + also_bought_item (0) + bought_together_item (0) = 2. The question asks for the network centrality score based on total connections, which is the degree centrality of 2.
Action 9: Action 9: Finish[2]
Observation 9: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 2
