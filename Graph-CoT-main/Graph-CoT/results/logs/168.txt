Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['The Winnowing Season: Book Two in the Amish Vines and Orchards Series', 'Falling to Pieces (A Shipshewana Amish Mystery)', 'A Wedding for Julia (The Pebble Creek Amish Series)', 'Whistling Past the Graveyard', 'AT&amp;T CL80103 Dect_6.0 Digital Accessory Handset Only', 'The Christmas Quilt: Quilts of Love Series']?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.

Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a next item recommendation based on a user's history of items. To recommend a next item, I should look at the relationships between the items in the user's history and find items that are commonly associated with them, such as also_viewed, also_bought, or bought_together items. I need to retrieve each item node from the history list first.
Action 1: Thought 1: I need to retrieve the node IDs for each item in the user's history list to work with them in the graph.
