Question: Can you name the item which has over 4 shared purchase items with EmjQi Tweeze Hair Remover Fast and EZ Tweezer Epilator?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you name the item which has over 4 shared purchase items with EmjQi Tweeze Hair Remover Fast and EZ Tweezer Epilator? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for items that share more than 4 "bought_together_item" neighbors with the item "EmjQi Tweeze Hair Remover Fast and EZ Tweezer Epilator". First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[EmjQi Tweeze Hair Remover Fast and EZ Tweezer Epilator]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007KGJT.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find all the "bought_together_item" neighbors of this item to understand what items are typically bought together with it.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00007KGJT, bought_together_item]
Observation 2: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00007KGJT are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the item "EmjQi Tweeze Hair Remover Fast and EZ Tweezer Epilator" has no bought_together_item neighbors. This suggests that there might be no items that are typically bought together with it, or the graph might not have this information for this particular item. Therefore, there are no items that share over 4 bought_together_item neighbors with it, since it has none to share.
Action 3: Finish[No such item exists, as the given item has no bought_together_item neighbors.]
Observation 3: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Emjoi AP-9T Tweeze Tweezer
