Question: What is the usual price of the items often purchased together with Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the usual price of the items often purchased together with Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the usual price of items often purchased together with "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt". First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_645.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_645" as the node ID, which appears to be a brand node rather than an item node. This suggests that the item name might not match exactly, or there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should try to retrieve the item node again with a more precise or alternative query.
Action 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_645" as the node ID, which appears to be a brand node rather than an item node. This suggests that the item name might not match exactly, or there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should try to retrieve the item node again with a more precise or alternative query, perhaps using a partial match or different phrasing.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to find the correct item node for "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt". Since the initial retrieval returned a brand node, I should try a different approach. Perhaps the title is slightly different. I'll try to retrieve with a partial keyword or check if there's a similar item.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_645.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval is still returning a brand node (brand_645) instead of an item node. This suggests that "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt" might not be an item title but rather a brand name. Let me verify this by checking the features of brand_645.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[brand_645, name]
Observation 4: The name feature of brand_645 are: Primitive Archer. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The brand node brand_645 has the name "Primitive Archer", which doesn't match "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt". This suggests that my retrieval attempts are incorrect. I need to find the correct item node. Let me try retrieving with a different approach - perhaps using "Thug Decocker Bolt" or checking if "Octane Crossbow" is part of the title.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Thug Decocker Bolt]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_567.
Thought 6: Thought 6: This is still returning brand nodes. I need to adjust my strategy. Perhaps "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt" is not the exact title. Let me try to search for items that might contain these keywords by using a broader search term like "Crossbow" to find related items, then check their titles to identify the correct one.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Crossbow]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_645.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieval is consistently returning brand nodes when I search for various keywords related to "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt". This suggests that either the item name is not in the graph as expected, or I need to approach this differently. Let me try to search for "Octane" or "Thug" to see if I can find any item nodes that might be related.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Octane]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000H4W7WS.
Thought 8: Thought 8: Great! Now I have an item node ID (B000H4W7WS) when searching for "Octane". Let me check the features of this node to see if it matches the item we're looking for.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B000H4W7WS, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B000H4W7WS are: 5.0 Mustang &amp; Super Fords. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title "5.0 Mustang & Super Fords" doesn't match "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt". This suggests that "Octane" might be a brand name or part of another item. Let me try searching for "Thug Decocker" to find the correct item.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Thug Decocker]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_567.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm still getting brand nodes when searching for various parts of the item name. This suggests that "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt" might not be the exact title in the graph. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for "Crossbow Thug" or checking if there are any items with "Decocker" in the title.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Crossbow Thug]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_645.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. This suggests that "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt" might not be an item title in the graph, or it might be listed under a different name. Let me try to search for "Bolt" as it's the last word in the name, which might be more specific to items.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Bolt]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_337.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm still getting brand nodes when searching for various keywords. This suggests that the item "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt" might not be in the graph with that exact title, or I need to approach this differently. Let me try to search for items that might be related to crossbows or bolts by using a more general term and then checking their features to find the correct one. Alternatively, I could try to find if there's an item with "Decocker" in its title.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[Decocker]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_880.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt". This suggests that this specific item might not exist in the graph with that exact title, or it might be listed under a different name. Since the question is about items purchased together with this item, and I can't find the item itself, I should try a different approach. Perhaps I need to look for items that have similar characteristics or are in the same category. Let me try to search for "Crossbow" items by looking at brand nodes and then their associated items.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[brand_645, name]
Observation 13: The name feature of brand_645 are: Primitive Archer. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: Since I'm unable to find the exact item "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt" through direct retrieval, I need to try a different approach. The question is about items purchased together with this item, so I need to find the correct item node first. Let me try to search for items that might contain parts of the name or are related to crossbows. I'll try to retrieve items with "Crossbow" in their title by using a different strategy - perhaps I need to look at the neighbors of brand nodes that might be related to crossbows.
Action 14: Action 14: NeighbourCheck[brand_645, item]
Observation 14: The item neighbors of brand_645 are: ['B0006ZQBRA']. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: Great! I found an item node (B0006ZQBRA) associated with the brand "Primitive Archer" (brand_645). Let me check the title of this item to see if it matches "Octane Crossbow Thug Decocker Bolt" or is related to crossbows.
