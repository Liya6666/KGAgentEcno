Question: What is the usual price of the items often purchased together with Mugen Power 2750mAh Extended Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 I9500 / I9505?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the usual price of the items often purchased together with Mugen Power 2750mAh Extended Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 I9500 / I9505? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the usual price of items often purchased together with a specific item (Mugen Power 2750mAh Extended Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 I9500 / I9505). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Mugen Power 2750mAh Extended Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 I9500 / I9505]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00FCJIQQO.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the items that are often purchased together with this item. According to the graph definition, item nodes have "bought_together_item" links. I should get the neighbors of this type for the node B00FCJIQQO.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00FCJIQQO, bought_together_item]
Observation 2: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00FCJIQQO are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that there are no bought_together_item neighbors for this node. This might be because the item doesn't have any recorded bought-together items, or perhaps I need to check other relationship types. Let me check if there are also_bought_item neighbors, as these might represent items that are often purchased together.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00FCJIQQO, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00FCJIQQO are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: It seems this item has no recorded bought_together_item or also_bought_item neighbors. Let me check if there are any other relationship types that might indicate items purchased together. I should also verify that I have the correct node by checking its features to ensure it's the right item.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00FCJIQQO, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00FCJIQQO are: Safari Garden Wireless Earbuds and built in Mic for Hands Free Calling. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieved node has a different title than expected. The question mentions "Mugen Power 2750mAh Extended Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 I9500 / I9505", but the node I retrieved has title "Safari Garden Wireless Earbuds and built in Mic for Hands Free Calling". This suggests I may have retrieved the wrong node. Let me try to retrieve the node again with a more specific query or check if there's another node that matches the item description.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Mugen Power 2750mAh Extended Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00FCJIQQO.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The same node ID is retrieved even with a slightly different query. This suggests that the graph might not have the exact item mentioned in the question, or the node might be indexed differently. Let me try to retrieve nodes with keywords from the item name to find the correct one.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Mugen Power 2750mAh]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I retrieved a brand node instead of an item node. Let me try a more specific query with the full product name to ensure I get the correct item node.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Mugen Power 2750mAh Extended Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 I9500 I9505]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00FCJIQQO.
Thought 8: Thought 8: The same node ID keeps being retrieved despite different queries, and its title doesn't match the expected item. This suggests that the graph might not contain the exact item mentioned in the question, or the node might be mislabeled. However, I should proceed with the available node to answer the question as best as possible. Since the node has no bought_together_item or also_bought_item neighbors, I cannot provide the usual price of items purchased together. I should check if there are any other relationship types that might be relevant, such as also_viewed_item or buy_after_viewing_item, but these are not "purchased together" relationships. Given the lack of data, I should conclude that there are no items often purchased together with this item.
Action 8: Action 8: Finish[No items often purchased together with this item were found in the graph]
Observation 8: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 44.99
