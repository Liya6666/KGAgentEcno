Question: What is the price of item Drogheria &amp; Alimentari Quintessence Basil Infused Oil -- 2.7 fl oz?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the price of item Drogheria &amp; Alimentari Quintessence Basil Infused Oil -- 2.7 fl oz? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item with the title "Drogheria &amp; Alimentari Quintessence Basil Infused Oil -- 2.7 fl oz". I need to first retrieve this item node from the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Drogheria &amp; Alimentari Quintessence Basil Infused Oil -- 2.7 fl oz]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0009GIZ0W.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B0009GIZ0W), I need to get the price feature of this item node as requested.
Action 2: NodeFeature[B0009GIZ0W, price]
Observation 2: The price feature of B0009GIZ0W are: . 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation returned an empty price feature. This might indicate that the price information is not directly available for this node. I should check if there are any alternative ways to get the price, such as checking if this item is linked to other items that might have price information, or if there's a different feature name. However, based on the graph definition, price is a standard feature for item nodes. Let me try to retrieve the node again to ensure I have the correct node ID, or check other features to confirm the node.
Action 3: NodeFeature[B0009GIZ0W, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B0009GIZ0W are: Herb Companion. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title feature returned "Herb Companion" which doesn't match the original query "Drogheria &amp; Alimentari Quintessence Basil Infused Oil -- 2.7 fl oz". This suggests that the node ID B0009GIZ0W might not be the correct node for the item I'm looking for. I should try to retrieve the node again with a more precise or alternative query.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[Drogheria & Alimentari Quintessence Basil Infused Oil -- 2.7 fl oz]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0009GIZ0W.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval is consistently returning the same node ID (B0009GIZ0W) but with a different title ("Herb Companion") than expected. This suggests there might be an issue with how the title is stored in the graph versus how it's being queried. Let me try retrieving with a partial match or different phrasing of the title.
Action 5: RetrieveNode[Quintessence Basil Infused Oil]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0009GIZ0W.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieval is still returning the same node ID (B0009GIZ0W) regardless of how I query it. This suggests that the graph might have a different title stored for this item than what appears in the question. Let me try to get more information about this node by checking its description or other features to see if it matches the item we're looking for.
Action 6: NodeFeature[B0009GIZ0W, description]
Observation 6: The description feature of B0009GIZ0W are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The description is empty, which isn't helpful. Let me try checking the category feature to see if it matches the expected item (basil infused oil).
Action 7: NodeFeature[B0009GIZ0W, category]
Observation 7: The category feature of B0009GIZ0W are: []. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The category is also empty. This suggests that the node B0009GIZ0W might not be the correct item node for "Drogheria &amp; Alimentari Quintessence Basil Infused Oil -- 2.7 fl oz". Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the item title in the graph is stored differently. I should try retrieving with the exact title but without the "&amp;" encoding, as the graph might store it as "&" instead.
Action 8: RetrieveNode[Drogheria & Alimentari Quintessence Basil Infused Oil -- 2.7 fl oz]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0009GIZ0W.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The retrieval consistently returns the same node ID (B0009GIZ0W) regardless of how I query it, but the title feature doesn't match. This suggests that the graph might have a different title stored for this item. Let me try to find this item by checking the brand connections or other relationships. First, let me see what brand this node is connected to, as the brand name "Drogheria & Alimentari" might help identify the correct item.
Action 9: NeighbourCheck[B0009GIZ0W, brand]
Observation 9: The brand neighbors of B0009GIZ0W are: []. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The node B0009GIZ0W has no brand neighbors, which is unusual for an item node. This further suggests that this might not be the correct node for the item we're looking for. Let me try a different retrieval approach by using just the brand name "Drogheria & Alimentari" to see if I can find the brand node first, and then find the specific item from there.
Action 10: RetrieveNode[Drogheria & Alimentari]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_473.
Thought 11: Thought 11: Now I have the brand node ID (brand_473) for "Drogheria & Alimentari". I can check what items are linked to this brand to find the specific item "Quintessence Basil Infused Oil -- 2.7 fl oz".
Action 11: NeighbourCheck[brand_473, item]
Observation 11: The item neighbors of brand_473 are: ['B00007B1C9']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The brand node brand_473 has only one item neighbor: B00007B1C9. This might be the correct item node for "Drogheria & Alimentari Quintessence Basil Infused Oil -- 2.7 fl oz". Let me check the title feature of this node to confirm.
Action 12: NodeFeature[B00007B1C9, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B00007B1C9 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The title feature returned HTML code instead of a clean title. This suggests the data might be messy. Let me check if this is indeed the correct item by looking at other features like description or category to confirm it's the basil infused oil product.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00007B1C9, description]
Observation 13: The description feature of B00007B1C9 are: ['Beautifully illustrated Italian cooking magazine']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The description "Beautifully illustrated Italian cooking magazine" doesn't match the expected basil infused oil product. This suggests that B00007B1C9 is not the correct item either. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the item title in the graph is stored with a different name. Let me try retrieving the node using just "Quintessence Basil Infused Oil" without the brand name to see if I get different results.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Quintessence Basil Infused Oil 2.7 fl oz]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0009GIZ0W.
Thought 15: Thought 15: The retrieval is still returning B0009GIZ0W, which doesn't seem to be the correct item. Let me try a broader search by retrieving nodes with "Basil Infused Oil" to see if there are other relevant items.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Basil Infused Oil]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0009GIZ0W.
Correct answer: 8.66
