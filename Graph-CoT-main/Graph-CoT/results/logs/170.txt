Question: Which item does this query: Its just a light weight everyday jacket that washes easy. It was inexpensive and so comfy directly match with?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item does this query: Its just a light weight everyday jacket that washes easy. It was inexpensive and so comfy directly match with? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item node matches a given description query. The description seems to be about a lightweight, easy-to-wash, inexpensive, and comfortable jacket. I need to find an item node whose description feature contains this text. Since I don't have a specific item title to retrieve, I should search for nodes that might match this description.

However, I realize that the available functions don't include a direct text search across all item descriptions. I need to think of another approach.
Action 2: Thought 2: Since I cannot directly search for text in descriptions across all items, I need to find another way. Perhaps I can start by retrieving nodes related to jackets or similar items. Maybe I can look for items with "jacket" in their title and then check their descriptions.

Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to find a way to locate the item that matches this description. Since I can't search all descriptions directly, I should try to find items with "jacket" in their title first, then check their descriptions. Let me start by retrieving a node with "jacket" as a keyword.
