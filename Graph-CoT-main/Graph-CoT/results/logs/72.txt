Question: How many products does the brand Blingles have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many products does the brand Blingles have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of products (items) that belong to the brand "Blingles". First, I need to find the brand node for "Blingles" in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Blingles]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_880.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node ID (brand_880), I need to find how many products (items) this brand has. Since brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, I should check the number of item neighbors for this brand node.
Action 2: NodeDegree[brand_880, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbor node degree of brand_880 are: 1. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The NodeDegree function returned 1, indicating that brand_880 (Blingles) has 1 product. However, I should verify this by checking the actual item neighbors to ensure accuracy and to get the item's name if needed for confirmation.
Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_880, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_880 are: ['B00DYCHF8Q']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The NeighbourCheck returned an item node ID ['B00DYCHF8Q'], but the question asks to provide the answer using node main features (names) rather than node IDs. I need to get the title of this item to confirm the product name.
Action 4: NodeFeature[B00DYCHF8Q, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00DYCHF8Q are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature returned appears to be HTML code rather than a readable product name. This might be an issue with the data. Let me try to get the actual product name by checking if there's a proper title or if I need to use a different approach. Since the question asks for the number of products, and NodeDegree already returned 1, I should confirm if this is correct by checking if there are any other item connections or if this is the only one.
Action 5: Thought 5: The title feature returned HTML code instead of a readable name, which might be a data issue. However, the question is primarily asking for the number of products, not their names. Since NodeDegree returned 1 and NeighbourCheck confirmed there is exactly one item node linked to brand_880, I can conclude that Blingles has 1 product. The instruction to "answer by providing node main feature" might be misinterpretedâ€”here, the answer is the count, not the feature itself. I should proceed with the count.
Observation 5: 
Thought 6: Action 6: Finish[1]
Action 6: Finish[1]
Observation 6: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 15
