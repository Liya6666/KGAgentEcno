Question: Find the items which are in the same brand and same category as item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary".
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Find the items which are in the same brand and same category as item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question asks for items that share both the same brand and same category as a given item. The given item appears to be identified by a partial HTML snippet "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"", which might be an error or incomplete. I need to first retrieve the actual item node using this identifier.
