Question: What is the item that has over 4 products frequently bought along with Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane &amp; Crutch Tips?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the item that has over 4 products frequently bought along with Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane &amp; Crutch Tips? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for an item that has over 4 products frequently bought along with "Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane &amp; Crutch Tips". First, I need to find the node for "Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane &amp; Crutch Tips" to get its ID.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane &amp; Crutch Tips]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00NGTH3DE.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find items that are frequently bought along with this item. The question mentions "frequently bought along with", which likely corresponds to the "bought_together_item" relationship. I should check the bought_together_item neighbors of this node.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00NGTH3DE, bought_together_item]
Observation 2: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00NGTH3DE are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The bought_together_item neighbors list is empty, which suggests that either this item has no bought-together items, or I might need to consider other relationship types. The question mentions "frequently bought along with", which could also correspond to "also_bought_item" relationships. Let me check the also_bought_item neighbors instead.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00NGTH3DE, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00NGTH3DE are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Both bought_together_item and also_bought_item neighbors are empty for this item. This is unusual. Let me verify if I have the correct node by checking its features to ensure it's the right item.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00NGTH3DE, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00NGTH3DE are: The Trail Rider Magazine- June 2014 Special Issue. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: This is not the correct item. The title "The Trail Rider Magazine- June 2014 Special Issue" doesn't match "Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane &amp; Crutch Tips". I need to retrieve the correct node using the full item name.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane & Crutch Tips]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_923.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieved node ID is "brand_923", which appears to be a brand node rather than an item node. This suggests that the item name might be associated with a brand. I should check the features of this node to confirm.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[brand_923, name]
Observation 6: The name feature of brand_923 are: Pocket Outdoor Media. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The brand node doesn't match the item name. I need to find the correct item node for "Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane & Crutch Tips". Let me try a different approach by searching with keywords from the item name.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane Crutch Tips]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_923.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm still getting a brand node instead of the item. Let me try to search with just the main keywords without the "&amp;" which might be causing issues.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane Crutch Tips]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_923.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm consistently getting a brand node when trying to retrieve "Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane & Crutch Tips". This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with this exact name. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for just "Rain-Guard" or "Non-Slip Cane Tips" to find related items.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Rain-Guard]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_22.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. This suggests that "Rain-Guard" might be a brand name rather than part of the item title. Let me try searching for "Non-Slip Cane Crutch Tips" instead.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Non-Slip Cane Crutch Tips]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_251.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item "Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane & Crutch Tips". This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with the exact name, or the name might be stored differently in the graph. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for items that contain keywords from the description, or I might need to look at brand nodes and their items to find the specific product.
Action 11: Thought 11: Since direct retrieval isn't working, I should try to find the item by looking at brand nodes that might be related to this product. The item name suggests it might be a medical or mobility aid product. Let me try to find brands that might sell such products and then check their items.
Observation 11: 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm having difficulty retrieving the specific item node directly. Let me try a different approach by searching for the exact title with proper encoding. The original question had "&amp;" which might need to be handled as "&" in the retrieval.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane & Crutch Tips]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_923.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm still getting a brand node instead of the item. This suggests that the item "Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane & Crutch Tips" might not exist in the graph with that exact name, or it might be stored differently. Let me try to search for items that might be related by looking at the category or description features of items from relevant brands. Since "Rain-Guard" appears to be a brand, let me check what items are associated with brand_22 (which was retrieved for "Rain-Guard").
Action 13: Action 13: NeighbourCheck[brand_22, item]
Observation 13: The item neighbors of brand_22 are: ['B00005N7S2']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: Now I have an item node ID (B00005N7S2) associated with the Rain-Guard brand. Let me check its title to see if it matches "Rain-Guard Non-Slip Cane & Crutch Tips".
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00005N7S2, title]
Observation 14: The title feature of B00005N7S2 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than a readable title. This suggests there might be an issue with how the title is stored. Let me try checking the description or other features to identify this item.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00005N7S2, description]
Observation 15: The description feature of B00005N7S2 are: ["Outside covers the exciting, active lifestyle of today's man.
