Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with a specific item. The item's title appears to be incomplete or malformed: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?". I need to first retrieve this item node using the given title fragment.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the node ID for the target item. The question asks which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with this item. "Co-viewed items" likely refers to items that are both viewed by the same users, which might correspond to the "also_viewed_item" relationships in the graph. I need to find items that have a significant overlap in their "also_viewed_item" neighbors with the target item. First, I should retrieve the list of "also_viewed_item" neighbors for the target item to understand what we're comparing against.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I now have the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for the target item. To find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with this item, I need to check other items and see how many of their also_viewed_item neighbors overlap with this list. I should start by getting a list of items that are connected to the target item through some relationship (like also_viewed_item themselves) or consider checking items that share common neighbors. Perhaps I should look at the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ and check each of their also_viewed_item lists to find overlaps greater than 4.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I already have the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for the target item. Now I need to check each of these neighbor items to see how many also_viewed_item neighbors they share with the target item. For each neighbor item, I should retrieve its also_viewed_item list and calculate the intersection size with the target's list. If the intersection size is greater than 4, that item qualifies. I should start with the first neighbor.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B000UHI2LW, also_viewed_item]
Observation 4: The node or neighbor type does not exist in the graph. This might because your given neighbor type is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The neighbor type "also_viewed_item" might not be correct for this specific node, or the node might not exist. Let me first verify if B000UHI2LW is a valid item node by checking its features.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 5: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 6: Thought 6: It seems B000UHI2LW might not be a valid item node in the graph. Let me try to retrieve the node using its ID directly to confirm if it exists.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I see the issue now. B000UHI2LW is actually a brand node (brand_756), not an item node. The also_viewed_item relationship only applies to item nodes, not brand nodes. I need to focus only on the item nodes in the also_viewed_item list. Let me check which of the neighbors from Observation 2 are actually item nodes by verifying their node types through their features.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 7: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 8: Thought 8: Since B000UHI2LW is a brand node (as confirmed by RetrieveNode), it won't have item features like "title". Brand nodes only have the "name" feature. More importantly, brand nodes don't have "also_viewed_item" relationships - only item nodes do. I need to filter the also_viewed_item neighbors from Observation 2 to only include actual item nodes. Let me check the node type of the next neighbor from the list.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[B002PXW18E]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm noticing a pattern - the neighbors I'm checking are turning out to be brand nodes, not item nodes. This suggests that when I retrieved the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ, the system returned a mix of item and brand node IDs. However, according to the graph definition, "also_viewed_item" should only connect to other item nodes. Let me verify the node type of my target item first, and then reconsider my approach.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I see that the target item B00005N7NQ has a title that matches the question's item description. Now I need to properly understand the "also_viewed_item" relationships. The graph definition states that item nodes are linked to "also_viewed_item" nodes, which should be other item nodes. However, the IDs I'm getting (like B000UHI2LW and B002PXW18E) are being identified as brand nodes when I retrieve them. This suggests that the "also_viewed_item" relationship might actually point to brand nodes in this specific graph, or there might be an inconsistency. Let me check the actual neighbor types available for the target item.
Action 10: Action 10: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 10: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: I see that the target item has a brand neighbor. Let me check what other relationship types are available for this item to understand the graph structure better. I should check all possible neighbor types to see what relationships exist.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 11: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 24. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The NodeDegree confirms there are 24 also_viewed_item neighbors for the target item. However, when I tried to check individual neighbors, they appeared to be brand nodes. This suggests that in this graph, the "also_viewed_item" relationship might actually connect to brand nodes rather than item nodes, or there might be a different interpretation. Let me try checking one of the neighbor IDs with a brand feature to confirm.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, name]
Observation 12: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm encountering issues with the graph structure. Let me try a different approach. Since B000UHI2LW was identified as brand_756 through RetrieveNode, let me check its brand feature directly.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[brand_756, name]
Observation 13: The name feature of brand_756 are: TWOBIU. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I see that brand_756 has the name "TWOBIU". This confirms that the IDs returned as "also_viewed_item" neighbors are actually brand nodes, not item nodes. This contradicts the graph definition which states that "also_viewed_item" should connect to other item nodes. There might be an inconsistency in the graph implementation. For the purpose of answering the question about "co-viewed items," I should interpret "also_viewed_item" as connecting to brands in this specific case. The question asks for items that share over 4 co-viewed items with the target item. Since the "also_viewed_item" neighbors are brands, I need to find other items that share over 4 of these brand connections with the target item. I should look for items that are connected to many of the same brands as the target item.
Action 14: Thought 14: I need to find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with the target item B00005N7NQ. Based on my observations, the "also_viewed_item" relationships in this graph appear to connect to brand nodes rather than item nodes. Therefore, I should interpret "co-viewed items" as shared brand connections. I need to find other items that are connected to more than 4 of the same brands as the target item.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I need to find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with the target item B00005N7NQ. Based on my observations, the "also_viewed_item" relationships in this graph appear to connect to brand nodes rather than item nodes. Therefore, I should interpret "co-viewed items" as shared brand connections. I need to find other items that are connected to more than 4 of the same brands as the target item. First, let me get all the items in the graph that might be candidates for comparison.
Action 15: Thought 15: I need to find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with the target item B00005N7NQ. Since the "also_viewed_item" relationships in this graph connect to brand nodes, I should find items that share more than 4 of these brand connections with the target item. First, I need to get the list of all items that are connected to the target item through some relationship, or consider checking items that might share common brand connections.
Observation 15:
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
