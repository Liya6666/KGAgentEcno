Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item with a specific title containing HTML-like text: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". First, I need to find the item node with this title in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00005N7NQ), I need to understand what the question means by "format of item." Since item nodes have features like title, description, price, img, and category, "format" might refer to one of these attributes. However, the question specifically mentions providing the "node main feature (e.g., names)," so I should check the main features of this item node. The title is already given, so perhaps it's asking for another key feature like category or description. Let me first check the category feature, as it might indicate the format (e.g., digital, physical, etc.).
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 2: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The category information shows this is a magazine subscription, which suggests a digital or periodical format. However, "format" might specifically refer to media type or file format. Since this appears to be a magazine subscription, the format could be "Digital" or "Print." I should check the description feature for more specific format information.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 3: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The description provides content details but doesn't explicitly mention the format. Since this is categorized as a magazine subscription, I should check if there are any format indicators in the title or other features. The title contains HTML-like text which might be a rendering artifact rather than the actual format. Let me check the title feature to see the complete title information.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature appears to be incomplete or corrupted, showing only the HTML-like text. This suggests that the "format" might refer to the actual media format of the item. Since this is a magazine subscription, the format could be "Digital" or "Print." Let me check if there are any other features that might indicate the format. I should also check the price or img features for clues, but the most relevant might be to look at similar items or check if the description contains format information. Alternatively, I can check the category more carefully - "Magazine Subscriptions" typically come in digital or print formats. Let me see if I can find more specific format information by checking the node's neighbors or related items.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 5: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The list of also_viewed_item neighbors doesn't directly help with determining the format. Since this is a magazine subscription item, I should check if there's any standard format information in the category or description. Let me check one of the similar items to see if their features indicate format. I'll retrieve a neighbor node and check its category and description.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, category]
Observation 6: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I need to first retrieve the neighbor node properly. Let me check the features of one of the also_viewed_item neighbors to understand the format pattern.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I see that B000UHI2LW is actually a brand node, not an item node. This suggests that the also_viewed_item neighbors might include both item and brand nodes, or there might be an issue with the neighbor list. Let me check the actual item node for B000UHI2LW to understand its format.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 9: Thought 9: It seems that B000UHI2LW is a brand node, not an item node. This suggests that the also_viewed_item neighbors might include brand nodes as well, or there might be an error in the neighbor list. Let me try checking another neighbor from the list to see if I can find format information.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[B002PXW18E]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm noticing that the also_viewed_item neighbors are returning brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests there might be an issue with how the neighbors are being retrieved or that the graph structure is different than expected. Let me try a different approach. Since the question is asking about the "format" of the item, and given that this appears to be a magazine subscription based on the category, I should focus on the category information which indicates this is likely a "Digital" or "Print" magazine subscription. Let me check if there are any other features that might explicitly mention format.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, img]
Observation 10: The img feature of B00005N7NQ are: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Iph04Jy3L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The image URL doesn't provide clear format information. Since this is a magazine subscription item and the category indicates it's in the "Magazine Subscriptions" category, the format is likely either "Digital" or "Print." However, I need to be more specific. Let me check if there are any format indicators in the description or if I can find more information by examining the brand of this item, as the brand might specialize in a particular format.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 11: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: Now I have the brand node ID (brand_0). I should check the brand's name to see if it provides any clues about the format. Additionally, I should check if the brand has other items that might indicate the typical format of their products.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 12: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The brand name is "Reason Magazine," which confirms this is a magazine subscription. For magazine subscriptions, the format is typically either "Digital" or "Print." Since the question specifically asks for the "format" and wants the answer in terms of node main features, I should check if there's any explicit format information in the item's features. Let me check the description again more carefully for format indicators, or see if the category provides more specific format details. Alternatively, I could check if there are any format-related keywords in the title or description.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 13: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The description doesn't explicitly mention the format. Since this is a magazine subscription item and the category indicates it's in "Magazine Subscriptions," I should look for more specific format information. Magazine subscriptions typically come in either "Digital" or "Print" format. Let me check if there are any other features or if I can find format information by examining the price feature, as sometimes digital and print versions have different pricing structures.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, price]
Observation 14: The price feature of B00005N7NQ are: . 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The price feature appears to be empty or missing. This doesn't help determine the format. Given that this is clearly a magazine subscription item (based on category and brand), and magazine subscriptions typically come in either "Digital" or "Print" format, I need to find more specific information. Let me check if there are any format indicators in the category hierarchy. The category includes "Professional & Educational Journals" and "Humanities & Social Sciences," but these don't specify format. Perhaps I should check if the item has any "also_bought_item" or "bought_together_item" neighbors that might indicate the format.
Action 15: Thought 15: Since the category and description don't explicitly specify the format, I should check other neighbor relationships to see if they provide format clues. Let me check the "also_bought_item" neighbors, as items bought together might share similar formats.
Observation 15:
Correct answer: Print Magazine
