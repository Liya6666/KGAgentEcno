Question: Which thing has over 4 joint views with Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which thing has over 4 joint views with Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items that have over 4 joint views with "Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker". This likely means I need to find items that share more than 4 also_viewed_item neighbors with this specific item. First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_89.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned "brand_89" as the ID, but the question is asking about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the item node again with the exact title.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_89.
Thought 3: Thought 3: It seems the retrieval is returning a brand node instead of an item node. This might indicate that the item title is not matching exactly, or there could be an issue with the graph. Let me try to retrieve the node with a slightly different approach. Perhaps I should look for items that contain keywords from the title, but since the RetrieveNode function works with exact matches, I need to ensure the title is correct. Alternatively, I might need to find the item through its brand or other means. Let me check if there are items linked to brand_89, as that might include the sneaker item.
Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_89, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_89 are: ['B00005QJE2']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Observation 3 shows that brand_89 has one item neighbor with ID 'B00005QJE2'. This might be the item we're looking for. Let me check the title feature of this item node to confirm if it matches "Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker".
Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005QJE2, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00005QJE2 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than the actual title. This suggests there might be an issue with how the feature is stored or retrieved. Let me try to retrieve the node again with a more precise approach. Perhaps the item title in the graph is stored differently. Since the question mentions "Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker", and we have an item node B00005QJE2 linked to brand_89, which might be Speedo, let's assume this is the correct item node for now. Now, I need to find items that have over 4 joint views (also_viewed_item neighbors) with this item. First, I should get the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005QJE2.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00005QJE2, also_viewed_item]
Observation 5: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005QJE2 are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: Observation 5 shows that the item B00005QJE2 has no also_viewed_item neighbors. This is unexpected and might indicate that the node I found is not the correct item for "Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker". Let me try to retrieve the item node again with a different approach. Perhaps I should search for nodes that contain "Speedo" and "Sneaker" in their titles, but since RetrieveNode requires exact matches, I might need to find the correct node through the brand. Let me check the name of brand_89 to confirm if it is indeed Speedo.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[brand_89, name]
Observation 6: The name feature of brand_89 are: Nylon Media Inc.. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The brand_89 is named "Nylon Media Inc.", which doesn't match "Speedo". This confirms that the initial retrieval was incorrect. I need to find the correct item node for "Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker". Let me try to retrieve the node with a more specific query or try to find it through its brand. First, let me try to retrieve the brand node for Speedo.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Speedo]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_421.
Thought 8: Thought 8: Now I have the brand node for Speedo (brand_421). Let me check its item neighbors to find the specific sneaker item.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[brand_421, item]
Observation 8: The item neighbors of brand_421 are: ['B000071HJ8']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: Observation 8 shows that brand_421 has one item neighbor with ID 'B000071HJ8'. Let me check the title feature of this item to confirm if it matches "Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker".
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B000071HJ8, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B000071HJ8 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The title feature is still returning HTML code instead of the actual title. This suggests that the feature might be stored in a different format or there's an issue with the graph. However, since the brand is Speedo, and it only has one item, this is likely the correct item node for the sneaker. Now, I need to find items that have over 4 joint views with this item. Joint views likely mean shared also_viewed_item neighbors. First, I need to get the also_viewed_item neighbors of B000071HJ8.
Action 10: Action 10: NeighbourCheck[B000071HJ8, also_viewed_item]
Observation 10: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B000071HJ8 are: []. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: Observation 10 shows that the item B000071HJ8 has no also_viewed_item neighbors. This is problematic because the question is about finding items with over 4 joint views with this item. If it has no also_viewed_item neighbors, then it cannot have any joint views with other items. However, this might be due to the item node not being correctly identified. Let me try to find the correct item node by searching for nodes with "Sneaker" in the title, but since RetrieveNode requires exact matches, I need to find a different approach. Perhaps I can look for items that have "Speedo" in their title or description. Since the graph might have multiple items, let me try to retrieve the node with the full title again, but perhaps there is a typo or variation in the title.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Speedo Women's Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_89.
Thought 12: Thought 12: The retrieval is still returning brand_89, which is not helpful. I need to find the correct item node. Since the title features seem to be returning HTML, perhaps I should look for items that have "Speedo" in their category or description, but that might be inefficient. Alternatively, I can try to find all items that have "Sneaker" in their title by attempting different variations, but since RetrieveNode requires exact matches, this is challenging. Let me try to retrieve the node with a different part of the title.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_923.
Thought 13: Thought 13: The retrievals are consistently returning brand nodes instead of item nodes, which suggests that the exact title matching isn't working as expected. Since the question is about finding items with joint views, I need to find the correct item node first. Let me try a different approach: I'll look for items that might have "Speedo" in their title by checking the items of the Speedo brand (brand_421) and then examine their features more carefully.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B000071HJ8, description]
Observation 13: The description feature of B000071HJ8 are: ['Established in Australia in 1998, Ride Cycling Review focuses on competitive road cycling. Every issue features lots of glossy photographs and long features on individual racers, competitions around the world, and the best new gear and equipment.']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The description of item B000071HJ8 is about cycling, not sneakers. This confirms that this is not the correct item for "Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker". I need to find the correct item node. Since direct retrieval isn't working, I should try to find items that have "Sneaker" in their title by using a different approach. Perhaps I can search for items with "Sneaker" in the category or description, but that might be broad. Let me try to retrieve the node with a different keyword from the title.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Women's Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_89.
Thought 15: Thought 15: The retrievals are consistently returning brand nodes instead of item nodes, which suggests that the exact title matching isn't working as expected for this particular item. Since I need to find the correct item node to proceed, I should try a different approach. Let me search for items that have "Sneaker" in their title by checking if there are any item nodes with "Sneaker" in their features. However, since I can't directly search by keyword, I might need to find the item through its also_viewed relationships or other means. Alternatively, I can try to find the brand node for Speedo and then check all its items to find the correct one.
Action 15: Action 15: NeighbourCheck[brand_421, item]
Observation 15: The item neighbors of brand_421 are: ['B000071HJ8'].
Correct answer: Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker, Speedo Women's Collection Canvas Slip-On Fashion Sneaker
