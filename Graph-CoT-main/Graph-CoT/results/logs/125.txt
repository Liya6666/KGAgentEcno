(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.

Question: What is the most popular publisher in category Professional & Educational Journals? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the most popular publisher in a specific category. First, I need to understand what "publisher" refers to in this context. Since the graph has "brand" nodes, and publishers are often brands, I should interpret "publisher" as a brand. The category is "Professional & Educational Journals". I need to find items in this category, then identify their brands (publishers), and determine which brand appears most frequently.
Action 1: Thought 1: I need to find items that belong to the category "Professional & Educational Journals". Since the graph doesn't have a direct way to retrieve nodes by category, I should first find some items in this category by searching with relevant keywords.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: I need to find items in the "Professional & Educational Journals" category. Since I can't directly query by category, I should search for nodes with keywords related to this category. Let me try retrieving nodes with "Professional & Educational Journals" or similar terms.
Action 2: Action 2: RetrieveNode[Professional & Educational Journals]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_804.
Thought 3: Thought 3: I retrieved a node with ID brand_804 using "Professional & Educational Journals" as a keyword, but this appears to be a brand node, not an item node. The question is about items in a specific category, so I need to find item nodes that have "Professional & Educational Journals" as their category. Let me try searching for item nodes with this category by using the category name as a keyword for item retrieval.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Professional & Educational Journals item]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_804.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I'm still getting a brand node when searching for "Professional & Educational Journals item". This suggests that the retrieval function might be matching the keyword to node features rather than specifically searching by category. Let me try a different approach - I should search for specific journal titles or terms that would likely belong to this category, then check their category features to confirm.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Journal]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00016JENW.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I retrieved a node with ID B00016JENW using "Journal" as a keyword. This appears to be an item node (based on the ID format). I should check its category feature to see if it belongs to "Professional & Educational Journals".
