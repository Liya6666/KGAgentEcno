Question: Can you tell me the average cost of the items frequently bought with Cascade Complete All-in-1 ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 26-Count Pouch (Pack of 5)?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you tell me the average cost of the items frequently bought with Cascade Complete All-in-1 ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 26-Count Pouch (Pack of 5)? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the average cost of items frequently bought with a specific item. First, I need to find the node for "Cascade Complete All-in-1 ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 26-Count Pouch (Pack of 5)" in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Cascade Complete All-in-1 ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 26-Count Pouch (Pack of 5)]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B004D4UKPY.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the items that are frequently bought with this item. Based on the graph definition, items are linked to "also_bought_item" nodes, which represent items that are frequently bought together. I should retrieve the also_bought_item neighbors of this node.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B004D4UKPY, also_bought_item]
Observation 2: The also_bought_item neighbors of B004D4UKPY are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that there are no also_bought_item neighbors for this node. However, the question specifically asks about "items frequently bought with" this item, which should correspond to the also_bought_item relationship. Since there are no neighbors, I should check if there might be other relationships that could represent frequently bought items, such as bought_together_item.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B004D4UKPY, bought_together_item]
Observation 3: The bought_together_item neighbors of B004D4UKPY are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Both also_bought_item and bought_together_item relationships returned empty lists. This suggests that either this item has no frequently bought together items in the graph, or I might need to consider other relationships. Let me check if there are any other relevant relationships for this item by examining its node features and other connections to understand the context better.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B004D4UKPY, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B004D4UKPY are: TV Guide: Special Issue Star Wars The Phantom Menace Collector's Set. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: There seems to be a discrepancy. The retrieved node ID B004D4UKPY has a title that doesn't match the original item name "Cascade Complete All-in-1 ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent". This suggests that the initial retrieval might have been incorrect. I should try to retrieve the node again with a more precise query or check if there's a different node for the dishwasher detergent item.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Cascade Complete All-in-1 ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00D7MNEPQ.
Thought 6: Thought 6: Now I have the correct node ID for the dishwasher detergent item. I need to find the items frequently bought with this item, which should be the also_bought_item neighbors. Let me check those neighbors.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00D7MNEPQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 6: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00D7MNEPQ are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: It's unusual that there are no also_bought_item neighbors. Let me check if this item has bought_together_item neighbors instead, as that might be the relationship used for frequently bought together items in this graph.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[B00D7MNEPQ, bought_together_item]
Observation 7: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00D7MNEPQ are: []. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: It's surprising that both relationships return empty lists. Let me verify the node features to ensure this is indeed the correct item and check if there might be other relationships or if the item has any neighbors at all.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00D7MNEPQ, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B00D7MNEPQ are: Consumer Reports Magazine July 13, 2013, The Kitchen of Your Dream. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: There's still a discrepancy. The retrieved node ID B00D7MNEPQ doesn't correspond to the dishwasher detergent item. I need to try a more specific retrieval query to find the correct node for "Cascade Complete All-in-1 ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 26-Count Pouch (Pack of 5)".
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Cascade Complete All-in-1 ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent Fresh Scent 26-Count Pouch Pack of 5]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_496.
Thought 10: Thought 10: The retrieval returned a brand node (brand_496) instead of an item node. This suggests that the query might be matching a brand name rather than an item title. I need to be more specific and include the full product name to find the correct item node.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode["Cascade Complete All-in-1 ActionPacs Dishwasher Detergent, Fresh Scent, 26-Count Pouch (Pack of 5)"]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B004D4UKPY.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm getting inconsistent results with the node retrieval. The same query returns B004D4UKPY which has a title about Star Wars, not dishwasher detergent. This suggests there might be an issue with the graph data or my retrieval approach. Let me try a different strategy - perhaps searching for keywords from the item name that are more unique to this product.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Cascade Dishwasher Detergent ActionPacs]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_366.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the retrieval function might be matching brand names rather than item titles. I should try to retrieve the item by using a more unique part of the name or try a different approach. Let me try to search for "Cascade Complete" which might be more specific to this product line.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[Cascade Complete]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_695.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve the specific dishwasher detergent item. This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand matches over item titles. I need to try a different approach - perhaps I should look for items that have "Cascade" in their title by checking node features, but since I can't directly search by feature content, I might need to find the brand node first and then get its items.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Cascade]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_88.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. Let me try a different approach. Since "Cascade" is a brand, I should first find the brand node and then look for its items to find the specific dishwasher detergent product.
Action 14: Action 14: NeighbourCheck[brand_88, item]
Observation 14: The item neighbors of brand_88 are: ['B00005QJE7']. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I found one item node (B00005QJE7) associated with the Cascade brand. Let me check its title to see if it matches the dishwasher detergent product I'm looking for.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00005QJE7, title]
Observation 15: The title feature of B00005QJE7 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary".
Correct answer: 29.89
