Question: How many items are usually bought together with pediped Grip-N-Go Brody Sandal (Toddler)?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items are usually bought together with pediped Grip-N-Go Brody Sandal (Toddler)? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of items that are usually bought together with "pediped Grip-N-Go Brody Sandal (Toddler)". First, I need to find the node for this item in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[pediped Grip-N-Go Brody Sandal (Toddler)]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00K05O272.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find how many items are usually bought together with this item. The question asks for "bought together" items, which corresponds to the "bought_together_item" neighbor type. I should use NodeDegree to get the count of bought_together_item neighbors.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00K05O272, bought_together_item]
Observation 2: The bought_together_item neighbor node degree of B00K05O272 are: 0. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The NodeDegree returned 0 for bought_together_item neighbors, but this seems unusual. Perhaps I should check if there are other types of relationships that might indicate items bought together, or maybe I need to verify the neighbor types available for this node. Let me check the actual neighbors of this node to see what relationship types exist.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00K05O272, bought_together_item]
Observation 3: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00K05O272 are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The bought_together_item neighbors list is empty, which confirms there are no items directly linked as "bought together" with this product. However, the question asks "how many items are usually bought together", and since the graph shows none, the answer should be 0. But let me double-check if there might be other relationship types that could be relevant, like "also_bought_item" which might indicate items frequently purchased together.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeDegree[B00K05O272, also_bought_item]
Observation 4: The also_bought_item neighbor node degree of B00K05O272 are: 0. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: Both bought_together_item and also_bought_item relationships return 0 neighbors for this item. This suggests that there are no items recorded as being bought together with the pediped Grip-N-Go Brody Sandal (Toddler) in the graph. The answer should be 0 items.
Action 5: Finish[0]
Observation 5: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 15
