Question: How many items are co-viewed with item Patrick The Stripping Warrior?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items are co-viewed with item Patrick The Stripping Warrior? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items co-viewed with "Patrick The Stripping Warrior". First, I need to find the item node for "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Patrick The Stripping Warrior]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_629.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_629" as the ID, but the question is about an item node, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should verify if "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" is indeed an item or if there's a mismatch. Perhaps the title is slightly different. Let me try to retrieve the node again with a more precise or alternative query.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Patrick The Stripping Warrior item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_645.
Thought 3: Thought 3: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of an item node. This suggests that "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" might actually be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me check the features of this brand node to confirm.
Action 3: NodeFeature[brand_629, name]
Observation 3: The name feature of brand_629 are: Hawaii Skin Diver. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The observation shows that brand_629 has the name "Hawaii Skin Diver", which doesn't match "Patrick The Stripping Warrior". Let me try a different approach. Since the question mentions "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" as an item, perhaps the exact title is different. I should search for nodes that might contain similar keywords.
Action 4: Thought 4: Since the direct retrieval isn't working, I should try to search for nodes containing keywords from "Patrick The Stripping Warrior". Let me try searching for "Patrick" first, as it might be part of the item title.
Observation 4: 
Thought 5: Thought 5: I need to find the correct item node for "Patrick The Stripping Warrior". Since direct retrieval isn't working, let me try searching for keywords from the title. I'll start with "Patrick" to find potential item nodes.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Patrick]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_170.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm still getting brand nodes when searching for "Patrick". This suggests that "Patrick" might be a brand name rather than part of an item title. Let me try searching for the full phrase "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" but with different formatting or try to find the item through other means. Perhaps I should search for "Stripping Warrior" instead.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Stripping Warrior]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_629.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" or its components. This suggests that "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" might actually be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me verify this by checking if there's a brand with this exact name.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Patrick The Stripping Warrior brand]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_668.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm still getting brand nodes with different IDs. Let me check the name feature of brand_668 to see if it matches "Patrick The Stripping Warrior".
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[brand_668, name]
Observation 8: The name feature of brand_668 are: Team Rock Limited. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm not getting the correct node. Let me try a different approach. Since the question mentions "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" as an item, perhaps the exact title is different. I should search for nodes containing "Warrior" which might be part of the item title.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Warrior]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_645.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" or its components. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with the exact phrase. Let me try a different strategy - perhaps searching for "Stripping" or looking for items that might be related to this concept. Since the question is about co-viewed items, maybe I need to find the correct item through its connections.
Action 10: Thought 10: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" or its components. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with the exact phrase. Let me try a different strategy - perhaps searching for "Stripping" or looking for items that might be related to this concept. Since the question is about co-viewed items, maybe I need to find the correct item through its connections.
Observation 10: 
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm having difficulty finding the item node for "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" through direct retrieval. Since the question is about co-viewed items, perhaps I should try to find items that might have this phrase in their title or description. Let me try to search for nodes with "Tutu" or "Ballet" as these might be related to a stripping warrior costume or similar items, based on the context.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Tutu]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_375.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm still getting brand nodes when searching for "Tutu". This suggests that my approach is not working. Let me reconsider the problem. The question is about "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" as an item, but all my retrieval attempts are returning brand nodes. This might indicate that "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" is actually a brand name, not an item title. Let me try to find items that belong to this brand by first finding the correct brand node.
Action 12: Thought 12: Since direct retrieval of "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" as an item is consistently returning brand nodes, it's likely that "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" is actually a brand name rather than an item title. I should try to find the brand node with this exact name first, then find its items.
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I need to find the brand node with the exact name "Patrick The Stripping Warrior". Let me try to retrieve it with a more specific query.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode["Patrick The Stripping Warrior" exact brand name]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_668.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm still not getting the correct brand node. Let me try a different approach. Since the question mentions "Patrick The Stripping Warrior" as an item, perhaps the exact title is different. Let me search for nodes containing "Stripping Warrior" as this might be unique to this item.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode["Stripping Warrior" exact]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006LKC7.
Thought 15: Thought 15: Great! I finally got an item node ID (B00006LKC7) instead of a brand node. This suggests that "Stripping Warrior" is likely part of the item title. Now I need to verify this is the correct item and then find its co-viewed items.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00006LKC7, title]
Observation 15: The title feature of B00006LKC7 are: Dub Magazine.
Correct answer: 0
