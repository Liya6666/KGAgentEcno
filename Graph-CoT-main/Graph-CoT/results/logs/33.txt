Question: How many bought-together items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many bought-together items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of bought-together items for a specific item. However, the item name appears to be HTML code ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"") rather than a proper product title. I need to first retrieve the correct item node using this identifier.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00005N7NQ), I need to find out how many bought_together_item neighbors this item has. I should use the NodeDegree function to count them.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, bought_together_item]
Observation 2: The bought_together_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 0. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the item has 0 bought_together_item neighbors. However, the question specifically asks to provide the answer using node main features (names) rather than just the count. Since there are no bought_together_item neighbors, I should confirm this by checking the neighbors directly.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, bought_together_item]
Observation 3: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The observation confirms that there are no bought_together_item neighbors for this item. Since the count is 0, and there are no specific items to list by name, I should provide the answer as 0.
Action 4: Finish[0]
Observation 4: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 0
