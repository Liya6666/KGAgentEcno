Question: Which item shares over 4 bought-together items with item 500 15-Minute Low Sodium Recipes: Fast and Flavorful Low-Salt Recipes that Save You Time, Keep You on Track, and Taste Delicious?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 bought-together items with item 500 15-Minute Low Sodium Recipes: Fast and Flavorful Low-Salt Recipes that Save You Time, Keep You on Track, and Taste Delicious? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 bought-together items with a specific item. First, I need to find the node for the given item: "500 15-Minute Low Sodium Recipes: Fast and Flavorful Low-Salt Recipes that Save You Time, Keep You on Track, and Taste Delicious".
Action 1: RetrieveNode[500 15-Minute Low Sodium Recipes: Fast and Flavorful Low-Salt Recipes that Save You Time, Keep You on Track, and Taste Delicious]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0000ARXXS.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the bought_together_item neighbors of this item to see what items are bought together with it.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B0000ARXXS, bought_together_item]
Observation 2: The bought_together_item neighbors of B0000ARXXS are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that item B0000ARXXS has no bought_together_item neighbors. This seems unusual. Let me verify this by checking the node degree for bought_together_item neighbors.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeDegree[B0000ARXXS, bought_together_item]
Observation 3: The bought_together_item neighbor node degree of B0000ARXXS are: 0. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Since the target item has no bought_together_item neighbors, it cannot share any bought-together items with other items. Therefore, no item shares over 4 bought-together items with this item. I should confirm this conclusion.
Action 4: Thought 4: The target item has no bought_together_item neighbors, meaning it has no items that are typically bought together with it. Therefore, it's impossible for any other item to share over 4 bought-together items with this item since there are none to share. The answer should be that no such item exists.
Observation 4: 
Thought 5: Action 5: Finish[No such item exists]
Action 5: Finish[No such item exists]
Observation 5: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 500 Low Sodium Recipes: Lose the salt, not the flavor in meals the whole family will love
