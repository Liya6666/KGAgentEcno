Question: How many items have the same bought-together items with item Buy Special Anger Duo of 2 Anger Games: I Was so Mad Board Game and Positive Ways to Handle Angry Feelings Card Game?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items have the same bought-together items with item Buy Special Anger Duo of 2 Anger Games: I Was so Mad Board Game and Positive Ways to Handle Angry Feelings Card Game? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items that share the same bought-together items with a specific item. First, I need to find the node for the given item: "Buy Special Anger Duo of 2 Anger Games: I Was so Mad Board Game and Positive Ways to Handle Angry Feelings Card Game".
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Buy Special Anger Duo of 2 Anger Games: I Was so Mad Board Game and Positive Ways to Handle Angry Feelings Card Game]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_501.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned a brand node (brand_501) instead of an item node. This suggests that the item title might not match exactly, or there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the item node again with a more precise approach or check if there's a different way to find it.
Action 2: Thought 2: The observation returned a brand node (brand_501), which is unexpected since we're looking for an item. This suggests that the exact title might not match any item node, or there might be a retrieval issue. I should try to retrieve the node with a partial match or alternative approach. Perhaps I can search for keywords from the title.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: Since the initial retrieval returned a brand node instead of an item node, I need to adjust my approach. The item title might be long or contain special characters that make exact matching difficult. I should try retrieving with a shorter, more distinctive part of the title, such as "Anger Duo" or "I Was so Mad Board Game".

Let me try a different approach to identify the correct item. Since the question is about bought-together items, I should focus on finding items that have the same bought-together relationships rather than trying to match the exact title. Let me check what items are connected to the brand nodes I found and see if any have descriptions or categories related to anger management games.

Let me try to find items that might contain "Anger Games" or similar terms in their description or category features.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Anger Games] (This might return a brand node again, but let's try to get its items and check their features)
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_501.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve by title keywords. Let me try a different approach - I'll check the items connected to brand_501 and examine their features to see if any match our target item.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[brand_501, item]
Observation 12: The item neighbors of brand_501 are: ['B00007HXZO']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I only have one item node (B00007HXZO) connected to brand_501, but its title feature returned HTML code instead of a readable title. Let me try to check other features of this item, like description or category, to see if it matches the target item.

Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item by its title. This suggests that the exact item might not exist in the graph, or there's an issue with the retrieval function. Since the question is about finding items with the same bought-together items, I need to first identify the correct item. Let me try a different approach - I'll search for items that might have similar content by checking the category or description features of items in the graph. However, without a way to search by content rather than title, this might be challenging. Let me try to find any item that contains "Anger" in its title by using a partial match approach.
