Question: What is the count of co-viewed items for item Sky Bedding IKAT DIAMOND &quot;Sun Tile&quot; 16-inch Round Decorative Pillow NWT?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the count of co-viewed items for item Sky Bedding IKAT DIAMOND &quot;Sun Tile&quot; 16-inch Round Decorative Pillow NWT? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the count of co-viewed items for a specific item. "Co-viewed" likely refers to "also_viewed_item" neighbors. First, I need to find the node for the item "Sky Bedding IKAT DIAMOND "Sun Tile" 16-inch Round Decorative Pillow NWT".
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Sky Bedding IKAT DIAMOND "Sun Tile" 16-inch Round Decorative Pillow NWT]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007AVIC.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00007AVIC), I need to find the count of its also_viewed_item neighbors. The question asks for the count of co-viewed items, which should be the number of also_viewed_item neighbors.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00007AVIC, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00007AVIC are: 0. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the also_viewed_item degree is 0, which seems unusual. I should verify this by checking the actual neighbors to ensure there are no also_viewed_item connections.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00007AVIC, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00007AVIC are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The observation confirms that there are no also_viewed_item neighbors for this item. Therefore, the count of co-viewed items is 0. Since the question asks to answer using node main features rather than IDs, but in this case there are no neighbors to list names for, I should simply report the count as 0.
Action 4: Finish[0]
Observation 4: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 0
