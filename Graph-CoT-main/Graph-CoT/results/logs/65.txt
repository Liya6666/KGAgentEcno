Question: How many items are in brand Northwest Chess % Eric Holcomb?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items are in brand Northwest Chess % Eric Holcomb? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the number of items in a specific brand (Northwest Chess % Eric Holcomb). First, I need to find the brand node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Northwest Chess % Eric Holcomb]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_552.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node ID, I need to find how many items are associated with this brand. Since brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, I should check the number of item neighbors for this brand node.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[brand_552, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbor node degree of brand_552 are: 1. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The question asks for the number of items in the brand, and I've found that there is 1 item neighbor. However, the instruction says to answer by providing node main features (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. So I need to identify the specific item node(s) linked to this brand and get their main feature (title).
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_552, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_552 are: ['B00008MNBN']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now I have the item node ID 'B00008MNBN'. To answer with the node's main feature (name/title) rather than just the count, I need to retrieve the title feature of this item node.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00008MNBN, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00008MNBN are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The observation seems to contain HTML markup rather than a clean title. I need to extract the actual title text from this feature. Let me try to get a cleaner version of the title feature or check if there's another way to get the item's name.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00008MNBN, description]
Observation 5: The description feature of B00008MNBN are: ['Northwest Chess covers chess news from Washington and Oregon.']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The description feature provides text content, but I need the title feature which should contain the item's name. The previous title observation had HTML markup. Let me try to get the title feature again, perhaps focusing on the text content within the HTML.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00008MNBN, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00008MNBN are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The title feature appears to be incomplete or malformed in the graph data. Since I need to provide the item's main feature (name/title) rather than just the count, but the title feature is not returning usable text, I should check if there are other features that might contain the item's name. Alternatively, I could use the description feature which gave me meaningful text, but the question specifically asks for the main feature (which for items is typically the title). Let me try one more approach - perhaps I can retrieve the node by its ID to see if there's a better way to get the title.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[B00008MNBN]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_625.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I seem to have made an error. Observation 7 suggests that retrieving the node ID 'B00008MNBN' returns a brand node (brand_625), but this was supposed to be an item node according to previous observations. This indicates some confusion in the graph structure. Let me reconsider the approach.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[brand_552, item]
Observation 8: The item neighbors of brand_552 are: ['B00008MNBN']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The observation confirms that 'B00008MNBN' is indeed an item node linked to brand_552. However, when I tried to retrieve it as a node, it returned a brand ID, which suggests there might be an issue with the node retrieval function for item nodes. Since I need to provide the item's main feature (title) but the title feature appears to be problematic, I should try to get the category feature or use the description as a fallback, as it contained meaningful text. The question asks for the number of items and their main features, so I need to provide both the count and the item name(s).
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00008MNBN, category]
Observation 9: The category feature of B00008MNBN are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The category feature doesn't give me the item's name/title. Since the title feature appears to be problematic and returns HTML markup instead of clean text, and the description feature gave meaningful content, I should use the description as the main feature for this item. The question asks for the number of items and to provide their main features (names). Since there is only 1 item, I can answer with the count and the description content as the item's identifying feature.
Action 10: Action 10: Finish[There is 1 item in brand Northwest Chess % Eric Holcomb: "Northwest Chess covers chess news from Washington and Oregon."]
Observation 10: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 1
