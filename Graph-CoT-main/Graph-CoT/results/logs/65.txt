Question: Can you tell me how many items were also purchased with Maxtor STM310004SSA20G-RK Shared Storage II 1 TB 3.5-Inch USB 2.0 Single Drive External Hard Drive?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you tell me how many items were also purchased with Maxtor STM310004SSA20G-RK Shared Storage II 1 TB 3.5-Inch USB 2.0 Single Drive External Hard Drive? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items that were also purchased with a specific item (Maxtor STM310004SSA20G-RK Shared Storage II 1 TB 3.5-Inch USB 2.0 Single Drive External Hard Drive). I need to first find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Maxtor STM310004SSA20G-RK Shared Storage II 1 TB 3.5-Inch USB 2.0 Single Drive External Hard Drive]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_887.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_887" as the ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should verify if this is indeed the correct node by checking its features to confirm it's an item node.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_887, name]
Observation 2: The name feature of brand_887 are: Absolute Media Ltd/Hi-Fi+. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation confirms that "brand_887" is indeed a brand node (Absolute Media Ltd/Hi-Fi+), not the item node I was looking for. This means my initial retrieval using the full item title may have failed to find the correct item node. I should try to retrieve the node using a more specific or different keyword from the item title, such as "Maxtor STM310004SSA20G-RK" or "Shared Storage II".
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Maxtor STM310004SSA20G-RK]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 4: Thought 4: This retrieval is also returning a brand node (brand_528) instead of the item node. I need to try a different approach. Perhaps the item title is not matching exactly in the graph. Let me try retrieving with a more distinctive part of the title, like "Shared Storage II" or "STM310004SSA20G-RK".
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[STM310004SSA20G-RK]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of the item node. This suggests that the exact title might not be stored as a node name, or there might be an issue with how I'm querying. Let me try retrieving with "Shared Storage II" which might be more distinctive.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Shared Storage II]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KX2R.
Thought 6: Thought 6: Great! Now I have an item node ID (B00006KX2R) for what appears to be the correct item. Let me verify this by checking its title feature to confirm it's the Maxtor external hard drive.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00006KX2R, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00006KX2R are: Sister 2 Sister. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The title "Sister 2 Sister" doesn't match the Maxtor hard drive I'm looking for. This suggests that "Shared Storage II" might not be unique enough. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for "Maxtor" combined with "1 TB" or using the full model number differently.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Maxtor 1 TB]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0009GJ2TK.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I got another item node ID (B0009GJ2TK). Let me check its title to see if it matches the Maxtor hard drive.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B0009GJ2TK, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B0009GJ2TK are: Linux Format - Incls Linux Format - DVD. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: This is still not the correct item. I need to be more precise with my retrieval. Let me try using the full model number "STM310004SSA20G-RK" or perhaps "Maxtor STM310004" which might be more specific.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[STM310004SSA20G-RK]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve with the model number. This suggests that the exact item title might not be directly retrievable with the keywords I'm using. Let me try a different strategy - perhaps searching for "Maxtor Shared Storage" or looking at brand nodes first and then finding items under that brand.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Maxtor Shared Storage]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_30.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the specific Maxtor item. This suggests that the exact item title might not be stored as a keyword in the graph, or my retrieval approach needs adjustment. Let me try a different strategy - perhaps the item has a different title in the graph. Let me try retrieving with "Maxtor" alone to see what items come up, then look for the specific hard drive.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Maxtor]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_385.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve with "Maxtor". This suggests that the RetrieveNode function might be prioritizing brand nodes over item nodes when the keyword matches both. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I need to find the brand node first, then look at its items to find the specific hard drive.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[brand_385, item]
Observation 12: The item neighbors of brand_385 are: ['B00006KYO9']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I found one item node (B00006KYO9) associated with brand_385. Let me check its title to see if it matches the Maxtor hard drive I'm looking for.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00006KYO9, title]
Observation 13: The title feature of B00006KYO9 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The title feature seems to be returning HTML code instead of a proper title. This suggests there might be an issue with how the data is stored. Let me try a different approach. Since the question is about items purchased together, I should look for the "bought_together_item" relationship. But first, I need to find the correct item node. Let me try retrieving with a more specific part of the model number or try a different keyword combination.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[1 TB 3.5-Inch USB 2.0]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0009GJ2TK.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm still not getting the correct item. Let me try a different approach. Since the question mentions "also purchased with", which likely refers to "bought_together_item" relationships, I should try to find the item by looking at its brand first. Let me try to find the Maxtor brand node more accurately.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Maxtor STM310004SSA20G-RK Shared Storage II]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_887.
Correct answer: 0
