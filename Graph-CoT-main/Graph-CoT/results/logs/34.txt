Question: How many bought-together items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many bought-together items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of bought-together items for a specific item. However, the item name appears to be incomplete or malformed - it looks like HTML/CSS class names rather than a proper product title. I need to first identify the correct item node.
Action 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of bought-together items for a specific item. However, the item name appears to be incomplete or malformed - it looks like HTML/CSS class names rather than a proper product title. I need to first identify the correct item node.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: The item name provided appears to be HTML/CSS code rather than a proper product title. I should try to retrieve the node using the given text as-is, but it's likely this won't match any actual item node in the graph. Let me attempt the retrieval first.
Action 2: Action 2: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 3: Thought 3: I successfully retrieved a node with ID B00005N7NQ using the given text. Now I need to verify if this is indeed the correct item node by checking its title feature to confirm it matches the query.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The node's title feature matches exactly with the given text in the question, confirming this is the correct item node. Now I need to find out how many bought_together_item neighbors this item has. I should use the NodeDegree function to count them.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, bought_together_item]
Observation 4: The bought_together_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 0. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The NodeDegree function shows that this item has 0 bought_together_item neighbors. However, I should verify this by checking the actual neighbors list to ensure there are indeed no bought_together items, as sometimes the degree count might not reflect the complete picture.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, bought_together_item]
Observation 5: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: Both the NodeDegree and NeighbourCheck confirm that this item has no bought_together_item neighbors. The question asks for the number of bought-together items, and the answer is 0.
Action 6: Action 6: Finish[0]
Observation 6: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 0
