Question: What is the usual price of the items often purchased together with Terminal Freeze?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the usual price of the items often purchased together with Terminal Freeze? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items often purchased together with "Terminal Freeze" and their usual prices. First, I need to find the node for "Terminal Freeze" in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Terminal Freeze]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_857.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned a brand node (brand_857) instead of an item node. This suggests that "Terminal Freeze" might be a brand name rather than an item title. The question is asking about items purchased together with "Terminal Freeze", which could mean items from this brand. I should check what items belong to this brand.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_857, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_857 are: ['B00ADT5S9G']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The brand "Terminal Freeze" has only one item: B00ADT5S9G. Now I need to find items that are often purchased together with this item. I should check the "bought_together_item" neighbors of this item node.
Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00ADT5S9G, bought_together_item]
Observation 3: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00ADT5S9G are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The item B00ADT5S9G has no bought_together_item neighbors. This suggests that perhaps "Terminal Freeze" is indeed a brand, but the question might be referring to an item with that title. Let me try to search for an item with "Terminal Freeze" in its title.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Terminal Freeze item]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_866.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm still getting a brand node (brand_866) when searching for "Terminal Freeze item". Let me try a different approach and search for items that might have "Terminal Freeze" in their title using a more specific query.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Terminal Freeze book]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_148.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when searching for "Terminal Freeze" with various suffixes. This suggests that "Terminal Freeze" might primarily be recognized as a brand in this graph. However, the question asks about items purchased together with "Terminal Freeze", which could be ambiguous. Let me try to find any item nodes that might have "Terminal Freeze" in their title by checking the brand items I found and examining their titles.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00ADT5S9G, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00ADT5S9G are: Famous Monsters of Filmland Magazine 214 BORIS KARLOFF Harry Houdini WOLF MAN CENTERFOLD Lon Chaney Jr GLORIA STUART. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The item under the Terminal Freeze brand doesn't seem to be related to "Terminal Freeze" in its title. This suggests that "Terminal Freeze" might not be an item in the graph, or I need to search differently. Let me try to search for "Terminal Freeze" as an exact item title.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode["Terminal Freeze" exact item title]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000F3UPN4.
Thought 8: Thought 8: Great! I found an item node with ID B000F3UPN4 that matches the exact title "Terminal Freeze". Now I need to find items that are often purchased together with this item by checking its bought_together_item neighbors.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[B000F3UPN4, bought_together_item]
Observation 8: The bought_together_item neighbors of B000F3UPN4 are: []. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The item "Terminal Freeze" has no bought_together_item neighbors. This suggests that perhaps this item doesn't have any recorded bought-together items in the graph. However, the question asks about items often purchased together with "Terminal Freeze". Let me try checking other types of relationships that might indicate items purchased together, such as also_bought_item.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[B000F3UPN4, also_bought_item]
Observation 9: The also_bought_item neighbors of B000F3UPN4 are: []. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The item "Terminal Freeze" has no also_bought_item neighbors either. This suggests that this particular item might not have purchase data in the graph. However, the question asks about items often purchased together with "Terminal Freeze". Let me try checking if there are other items with similar titles or if "Terminal Freeze" might refer to something else. Perhaps I should check the category or description of this item to understand what it is.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B000F3UPN4, category]
Observation 10: The category feature of B000F3UPN4 are: []. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The category is empty. Let me check the description of this item to confirm it's the correct "Terminal Freeze" and understand what it is.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B000F3UPN4, description]
Observation 11: The description feature of B000F3UPN4 are: []. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The item B000F3UPN4 has no description or category, which makes it difficult to verify. However, since it was retrieved with the exact title "Terminal Freeze", it's likely the correct item. Given that it has no bought_together_item or also_bought_item neighbors, I should consider checking if there are other relationship types that might indicate items purchased together, or perhaps the question is referring to a different interpretation. Let me try checking the brand of this item to see if there are other items from the same brand that might be purchased together.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[B000F3UPN4, brand]
Observation 12: The brand neighbors of B000F3UPN4 are: []. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The item "Terminal Freeze" (B000F3UPN4) has no brand, bought_together_item, or also_bought_item neighbors. This suggests that this item might not have complete data in the graph. However, the question specifically asks about items often purchased together with "Terminal Freeze". Since the direct relationships are empty, I should consider checking other items that might be related through different means. Perhaps "Terminal Freeze" is a book or a product that is part of a series, and I need to find items that are commonly bought with it. Let me try to search for items with similar titles or check if there are other nodes that might be related to "Terminal Freeze".
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Terminal Freeze novel]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_148.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm still getting brand nodes when searching for "Terminal Freeze novel". This suggests that "Terminal Freeze" might be primarily recognized as a brand in this graph. However, the question asks about items purchased together with "Terminal Freeze", which could mean items from this brand that are often purchased together. Let me check what items belong to the Terminal Freeze brand and see if they have bought_together relationships.
Action 14: Action 14: NeighbourCheck[brand_148, item]
Observation 14: The item neighbors of brand_148 are: ['B00006K4BR']. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I found that brand_148 (which seems to be associated with "Terminal Freeze") has one item: B00006K4BR. Let me check the title of this item to confirm if it's related to Terminal Freeze.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00006K4BR, title]
Observation 15: The title feature of B00006K4BR are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary".
Correct answer: 9.8
