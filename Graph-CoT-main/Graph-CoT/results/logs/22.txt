Question: How many co-viewed items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many co-viewed items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about co-viewed items for an item with a title containing "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". This appears to be an HTML fragment rather than a complete item title. I need to first find the correct item node in the graph.

Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 1: The question contains an HTML fragment "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"" which appears to be part of an item title rather than a complete title. I need to find the item node that has this text in its title feature. Since RetrieveNode typically expects exact matches, I might need to search for items that contain this text in their title.
Action 2: Thought 2: Since the question contains an HTML fragment that's likely part of an item title, I need to find the item node that contains this text in its title feature. However, the available functions don't include a text search capability. I should try to retrieve the node using the provided text as a keyword, as it might be a unique identifier in the graph.
