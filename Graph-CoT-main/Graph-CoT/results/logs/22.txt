Question: Can you tell me the cost of Swimming Naked with Jellyfish: The coming-of-age story of a girl who hates semicolons, loves extremes, and lives her life exposed.?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you tell me the cost of Swimming Naked with Jellyfish: The coming-of-age story of a girl who hates semicolons, loves extremes, and lives her life exposed.? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price (cost) of an item with a specific title. I need to first retrieve the item node using its title.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Swimming Naked with Jellyfish: The coming-of-age story of a girl who hates semicolons, loves extremes, and lives her life exposed.]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KPSW.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID, I need to get the price feature of this item node since the question asks for the cost.
Action 2: NodeFeature[B00006KPSW, price]
Observation 2: The price feature of B00006KPSW are: . 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The price feature seems to be empty or not available. I should check if I have the correct node by verifying its title feature to ensure it matches the item in question.
Action 3: NodeFeature[B00006KPSW, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00006KPSW are: New Moon: the Magazine for Girls &amp; Their Dreams. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title of the retrieved node does not match the item in the question. I need to find the correct node for "Swimming Naked with Jellyfish: The coming-of-age story of a girl who hates semicolons, loves extremes, and lives her life exposed." Perhaps the title was not exact in the retrieval. I should try to retrieve with a shorter or more precise keyword from the title.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[Swimming Naked with Jellyfish]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000WDS5Z2.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I have retrieved a new node with ID B000WDS5Z2 using a shorter keyword. I should verify if this is the correct node by checking its title feature.
Action 5: NodeFeature[B000WDS5Z2, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B000WDS5Z2 are: Scuba Diving (1-year). 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieved node still doesn't match the desired title. The full title is quite long and specific. I should try retrieving with a different part of the title or consider that the item might not be in the graph. Let me try retrieving with "Jellyfish" as it's a distinctive keyword from the title.
Action 6: RetrieveNode[Jellyfish]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7SH.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I retrieved a node with "Jellyfish" but need to verify if it's the correct item. Let me check its title feature to see if it matches the book title from the question.
Action 7: NodeFeature[B00005N7SH, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B00005N7SH are: Reptiles (1-year). 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The retrieved nodes so far don't match the desired title. The full title is very specific: "Swimming Naked with Jellyfish: The coming-of-age story of a girl who hates semicolons, loves extremes, and lives her life exposed." This appears to be a book title. Let me try retrieving with a more unique part of the title - perhaps "Swimming Naked" which might be more distinctive.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Swimming Naked]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000WDS5Z2.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I got the same node ID (B000WDS5Z2) as before when searching for "Swimming Naked". Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for "semicolons" which is a unique word in the title, or try to search for the full title but with proper encoding/formatting.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[semicolons]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_712.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I retrieved a brand node (brand_712) when searching for "semicolons", which is not what I want. This suggests that the exact item might not be in the graph, or I need to try a different search strategy. Let me try searching for the full title with proper encoding for special characters like colons and commas.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Swimming Naked with Jellyfish: The coming-of-age story of a girl who hates semicolons, loves extremes, and lives her life exposed]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KPSW.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I keep getting the same incorrect node (B00006KPSW) when searching for the full title. This suggests that the exact item might not be in the graph database, or there might be an issue with how the title is stored. Let me try one more approach - searching for "coming-of-age story" which is part of the subtitle and might be more unique.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[coming-of-age story]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KPSW.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I keep retrieving the same incorrect node (B00006KPSW) regardless of which part of the title I search for. This strongly suggests that the specific item "Swimming Naked with Jellyfish: The coming-of-age story of a girl who hates semicolons, loves extremes, and lives her life exposed" is not present in the graph database. Since I cannot find the correct node, I cannot retrieve its price feature. I should conclude that the item is not available in the database.
Action 12: Finish[The item "Swimming Naked with Jellyfish: The coming-of-age story of a girl who hates semicolons, loves extremes, and lives her life exposed" is not found in the graph database, so its price cannot be determined.]
Observation 12: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 2.99
