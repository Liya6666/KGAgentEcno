Question: How many items are in brand Canada History Society?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items are in brand Canada History Society? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the number of items associated with a specific brand (Canada History Society). First, I need to find the brand node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Canada History Society]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_811.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node ID, I need to find how many items are linked to this brand. Since brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, I should check the number of item neighbors for this brand node.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[brand_811, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbor node degree of brand_811 are: 1. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that brand_811 has 1 item neighbor. However, the question asks to provide the answer using node main features (names) rather than just the count. I should retrieve the actual item node(s) linked to this brand to get their title(s).
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_811, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_811 are: ['B004CGXNNE']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now I have the item node ID for the item linked to brand_811. To answer the question properly, I need to get the title (main feature) of this item node, and then state that there is 1 item with that title in the brand Canada History Society.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B004CGXNNE, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B004CGXNNE are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The observation seems to return HTML code instead of the actual title text. I need to extract the actual title from this feature. Let me try to get the title feature again, or perhaps check if there's a different way to retrieve the proper title.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B004CGXNNE, title] (trying again to get the actual title text)
Observation 5: The title feature of B004CGXNNE are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The title feature appears to be returning HTML code rather than clean text. This might be an issue with how the feature is stored. Let me try to get the description or category feature instead, as those might contain the actual product name in a more readable format.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B004CGXNNE, description]
Observation 6: The description feature of B004CGXNNE are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The description feature is empty. Let me try checking the category feature to see if it contains the item name.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B004CGXNNE, category]
Observation 7: The category feature of B004CGXNNE are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'History']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The category feature shows the item's categories but not the actual title. Since the title feature returned HTML code, I should try to parse it or look for the actual text content. However, based on the available features and the requirement to provide node main features, I should report that there is 1 item in brand Canada History Society, and its title appears to be embedded in HTML. Since the question asks for the answer using node main features, I'll provide the count and mention that the item's title is represented by the node ID B004CGXNNE, as the title feature contains HTML markup.
Action 8: Action 8: Finish[There is 1 item in brand Canada History Society. The item's title is represented by node B004CGXNNE, though the title feature contains HTML markup rather than plain text.]
Observation 8: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 1
