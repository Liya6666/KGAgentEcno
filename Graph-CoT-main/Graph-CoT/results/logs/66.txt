Question: How many items does Spoken from the Heart: Journey from Fear to Faith (Volume 1) have in its also-bought section?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items does Spoken from the Heart: Journey from Fear to Faith (Volume 1) have in its also-bought section? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the "also-bought" items for "Spoken from the Heart: Journey from Fear to Faith (Volume 1)". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Spoken from the Heart: Journey from Fear to Faith (Volume 1)]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00009ALK9.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the also_bought_item neighbors of this item node. The question asks for the number of items in the also-bought section, but specifically requests that I provide the node main features (names) rather than just the count or IDs.
Action 2: Thought 2: The question asks for the number of items in the also-bought section, but specifically requests that I provide the node main features (names) rather than just the count or IDs. This means I need to first get the list of also_bought_item neighbors, then for each of those item nodes, retrieve their main feature (title) to get the names.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to get the list of also_bought_item neighbors for node B00009ALK9, then for each neighbor item node, retrieve its title feature to get the names.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00009ALK9, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00009ALK9 are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The observation shows that there are no also_bought_item neighbors for this node. This means the also-bought section is empty. Since the question asks for the number of items and their names, I should confirm this result and then provide the appropriate response.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeDegree[B00009ALK9, also_bought_item]
Observation 4: The also_bought_item neighbor node degree of B00009ALK9 are: 0. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The observations confirm that there are no also_bought_item neighbors for this item. Therefore, the number of items in the also-bought section is 0, and there are no names to provide. I should finish with this answer.
Action 5: Finish[0]
Observation 5: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 1
