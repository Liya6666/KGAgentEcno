Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item with a specific title containing HTML-like code. I need to first retrieve the item node using the given title.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have the item node ID. The question is asking about the "format" of this item. Looking at the available item features (title, description, price, img, category), "format" might be part of the description or category. I should check the node's features to find format information.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 2: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The description doesn't seem to contain format information. Since "format" could be related to the category or might be a specific attribute, I should check the category feature of this item node.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 3: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The category information shows this is a magazine subscription, but doesn't specify the format. Since this appears to be a magazine/journal item, the format might be indicated in the title or description. Let me check the title feature to see if it contains format information.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title appears to be HTML code rather than a readable product title. This suggests there might be an issue with how the item is stored in the graph. Since the question specifically asks about the "format" of this item, and given that this appears to be a magazine/journal based on the category, the format might be "Magazine" or "Subscription". However, I should check if there are any other features or neighbors that might contain format information. Let me check if this item has a brand neighbor, as sometimes brand information might indicate the format.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 5: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I have the brand node ID. Let me check the brand name to see if it provides any format information.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 6: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The brand name is "Reason Magazine", which confirms this is a magazine. Since the question asks about the "format" of the item, and based on the category information showing "Magazine Subscriptions" and the brand being a magazine, the format is likely "Magazine" or "Subscription". However, I should check if there are any other neighbors or features that might specify the format more precisely. Let me check the also_viewed_item neighbors to see if similar items have format information in their titles or categories.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 7: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I have a list of also_viewed_item neighbors. To understand the format, I should check the category or title of one of these similar items to see if they share a common format. Let me check the category of one of these neighbors.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, category]
Observation 8: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The node B000UHI2LW might not exist or I might have made an error. Let me check the title of one of the also_viewed_item neighbors to understand what type of items they are, which might give clues about the format.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 9: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 10: Thought 10: It seems the node B000UHI2LW might not exist in the graph. Let me try checking a different also_viewed_item neighbor from the list. I'll try B002PXW18E.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B002PXW18E, title]
Observation 10: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 11: Thought 11: It seems that the also_viewed_item neighbor nodes might not be accessible with their IDs directly. Perhaps I need to retrieve them by their titles first, or there might be an issue with how the graph is structured. Let me go back to the original item and reconsider. The question is asking about the "format" of the item. Based on the category information I already have ("Magazine Subscriptions", "Professional & Educational Journals", etc.), and the brand name "Reason Magazine", the format is likely "Magazine" or "Subscription". Since the title appears to be HTML code, this might be a data issue, but the format can be inferred from the available information.
Action 11: Action 11: Finish[Magazine Subscription]
Observation 11: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Print Magazine
