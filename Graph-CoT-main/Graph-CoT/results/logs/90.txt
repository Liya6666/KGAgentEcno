Question: Which product has more than 4 co-views with the product LI-40B / LI-42B Equivalent Lithium Ion Battery for OLYMPUS Digital Camera - Stylus 700 710 720SW IR-300 D-630?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which product has more than 4 co-views with the product LI-40B / LI-42B Equivalent Lithium Ion Battery for OLYMPUS Digital Camera - Stylus 700 710 720SW IR-300 D-630? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about products that have more than 4 co-views with a specific item (LI-40B / LI-42B Equivalent Lithium Ion Battery for OLYMPUS Digital Camera - Stylus 700 710 720SW IR-300 D-630). "Co-views" likely refers to also_viewed_item relationships. I need to first find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[LI-40B / LI-42B Equivalent Lithium Ion Battery for OLYMPUS Digital Camera - Stylus 700 710 720SW IR-300 D-630]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_232.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_232" as the ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should try to retrieve the item node again, perhaps with a more precise or alternative query.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[LI-40B / LI-42B Equivalent Lithium Ion Battery for OLYMPUS Digital Camera - Stylus 700 710 720SW IR-300 D-630 item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_232.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node (brand_232) instead of an item node. This suggests that the item title might be incorrectly mapped or there's an issue with the graph. I should try to find the item by looking for nodes with similar titles or by checking if this is actually a brand name. Let me try to retrieve the brand node's features to understand what it represents.
Action 3: NodeFeature[brand_232, name]
Observation 3: The name feature of brand_232 are: Luerzers Intl Archive. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The brand node brand_232 has the name "Luerzers Intl Archive", which doesn't match the product name in the question. This confirms that there's a mismatch. I need to find the actual item node. Let me try to search for keywords from the product title that might help retrieve the correct item node.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[LI-40B LI-42B Equivalent Lithium Ion Battery OLYMPUS Digital Camera Stylus 700 710 720SW IR-300 D-630]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 5: Thought 5: Still getting brand nodes instead of the item. Let me try a different approach - search for just the battery model number or camera model to find related items.
Action 5: RetrieveNode[LI-40B]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_653.
Thought 6: Thought 6: This is consistently returning brand nodes, which suggests that the graph might not have this specific item node, or the retrieval function is not working as expected for this query. Since the question is about co-views (also_viewed_item relationships), I need to find the item node first. Let me try to search for "Lithium Ion Battery" to see if I can find related items and then narrow down.
Action 6: RetrieveNode[Lithium Ion Battery OLYMPUS Digital Camera]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007B051.
Thought 7: Thought 7: Great! Now I have an item node ID: B00007B051. Let me verify that this is the correct item by checking its title feature.
Action 7: NodeFeature[B00007B051, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B00007B051 are: Nikon World. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The title "Nikon World" doesn't match the product in question. This suggests that the retrieval might not be accurate. Let me try a more specific query with the exact battery model and camera models mentioned in the original question.
Action 8: RetrieveNode[LI-40B / LI-42B Equivalent Lithium Ion Battery for OLYMPUS Digital Camera Stylus 700 710 720SW IR-300 D-630]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_232.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the specific item. This suggests that the exact item might not be in the graph, or the retrieval function is not matching it correctly. Since the question is about co-views (also_viewed_item relationships), I need to find the item node. Let me try to search for just "OLYMPUS Digital Camera Battery" to see if I can find a related item that might be the correct one or have similar co-views.
Action 9: RetrieveNode[OLYMPUS Digital Camera Battery]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007GAMH.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I have an item node ID: B00007GAMH. Let me check its title to see if it's related to the battery mentioned in the question.
Action 10: NodeFeature[B00007GAMH, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B00007GAMH are: Moto Kids. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The retrieved items so far don't match the battery product in question. This suggests the specific item might not be directly retrievable with the current approach. Since the question is about co-views (also_viewed_item relationships), I need to find the correct item node first. Let me try a different strategy - search for the exact battery model number "LI-40B" or "LI-42B" as keywords in item titles by trying to retrieve nodes with those model numbers.
Action 11: RetrieveNode[LI-40B battery]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BYTOWA.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I have a new item node ID: B000BYTOWA. Let me check its title to see if it matches the battery product in question.
Action 12: NodeFeature[B000BYTOWA, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B000BYTOWA are: Backpacking Light. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The retrieved items still don't match the battery product. This suggests that the specific item might not be in the graph or the retrieval function isn't finding it. However, since the question is about co-views (also_viewed_item relationships), I need to find the correct item node. Let me try to search for "OLYMPUS Stylus battery" which might be more specific to the camera models mentioned.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[OLYMPUS Stylus battery]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the specific battery product mentioned in the question might not be directly retrievable with the current approach. However, since the question is about co-views (also_viewed_item relationships), I need to find the correct item node. Let me try a different approach - search for the exact camera models mentioned in the question to see if I can find related items that might lead me to the battery.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[OLYMPUS Stylus 700]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the specific item or related items. This suggests that the exact item mentioned in the question might not be directly retrievable, or there's an issue with the retrieval function. However, since the question is about co-views (also_viewed_item relationships), I need to find the correct item node. Let me try to search for "Lithium Ion Battery" and see if I can find multiple items and then check their titles to identify the correct one.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[LI-40B / LI-42B Equivalent Lithium Ion Battery]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BYTOWA.
