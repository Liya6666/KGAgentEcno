Question: Given this request: marriage without regrets, what is the supplementary item?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Given this request: marriage without regrets, what is the supplementary item? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a supplementary item related to "marriage without regrets". This seems to be looking for an item that might be recommended or related to this theme. I need to find an item node that matches this description. Since "marriage without regrets" could be a title or part of a description, I should search for it in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[marriage without regrets]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000EQ401K.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have found a node with ID B000EQ401K that matches "marriage without regrets". The question asks for a "supplementary item" related to this. In e-commerce graphs, supplementary items are often connected through relationships like "also_bought_item", "bought_together_item", or "buy_after_viewing_item". I should check what neighbors this node has to find supplementary items.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B000EQ401K, bought_together_item]
Observation 2: The bought_together_item neighbors of B000EQ401K are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The bought_together_item neighbors returned an empty list. I should try other relationship types that might indicate supplementary items, such as also_bought_item or buy_after_viewing_item. Let me check also_bought_item neighbors next.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B000EQ401K, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B000EQ401K are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Both bought_together_item and also_bought_item neighbors returned empty lists. Let me try checking buy_after_viewing_item neighbors, as these might also indicate supplementary items that customers viewed after looking at the main item.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B000EQ401K, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 4: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B000EQ401K are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: All the typical supplementary item relationships (bought_together_item, also_bought_item, buy_after_viewing_item) returned empty lists. Let me try checking also_viewed_item neighbors, as these might also indicate related items that customers viewed alongside the main item.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B000EQ401K, also_viewed_item]
Observation 5: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B000EQ401K are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: All the item-to-item relationships returned empty lists. Perhaps I should check if this node is actually an item node by examining its features. The question mentions providing "node main feature (e.g., names)", so I should first understand what type of node B000EQ401K is and what its main features are.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B000EQ401K, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B000EQ401K are: Best Life (1-year). 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The node B000EQ401K has the title "Best Life (1-year)", which doesn't seem to directly relate to "marriage without regrets". This suggests that my initial retrieval might not have found the correct node. Let me try retrieving the node again with a more specific query or check if there are other nodes related to "marriage without regrets". Perhaps "marriage without regrets" is part of the description rather than the title.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B000EQ401K, description]
Observation 7: The description feature of B000EQ401K are: []. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The description feature is empty for this node. It seems that "marriage without regrets" might not be directly matching a node title. Perhaps I should search for nodes that have "marriage without regrets" in their description or category features. Let me try to find nodes with this phrase in their description.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[marriage without regrets description]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000EQ401K.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The retrieval is still returning the same node ID B000EQ401K. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps "marriage without regrets" is not a direct node identifier but rather a theme or category. I should check the category feature of the node I found to see if it relates to marriage or relationships.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B000EQ401K, category]
Observation 9: The category feature of B000EQ401K are: []. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The node B000EQ401K doesn't seem to have meaningful features related to "marriage without regrets". Perhaps I need to reconsider the query. The phrase "marriage without regrets" might be the title of an item. Let me try retrieving it as a complete phrase with proper capitalization or check if there are other nodes that might match this theme. I should also consider that "marriage without regrets" could be a book or product title.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode["Marriage Without Regrets"]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000EQ401K.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm consistently getting the same node ID (B000EQ401K) for "marriage without regrets" queries, but its title "Best Life (1-year)" doesn't match. Perhaps this node actually represents "Marriage Without Regrets" but has incorrect or incomplete feature data. Let me check if this node has any brand relationship, as that might provide more context about what this item actually is.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[B000EQ401K, brand]
Observation 11: The brand neighbors of B000EQ401K are: []. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The node B000EQ401K doesn't have any brand neighbors either. This suggests that either the node data is incomplete or "marriage without regrets" might not be directly referencing a specific item node. Perhaps "marriage without regrets" is actually a brand name rather than an item title. Let me try retrieving it as a brand node instead.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[marriage without regrets brand]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_307.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I found a brand node with ID brand_307 that matches "marriage without regrets". The question asks for a "supplementary item" related to this brand. Since brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, I should check what items are associated with this brand to find potential supplementary items.
Action 13: Action 13: NeighbourCheck[brand_307, item]
Observation 13: The item neighbors of brand_307 are: ['B00006KJPV']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I found that brand_307 has one item neighbor with ID 'B00006KJPV'. The question asks for a "supplementary item" related to "marriage without regrets". Since this is a brand, the supplementary item would likely be another item from the same brand or an item that complements the main item. However, I only found one item associated with this brand. Let me check the features of this item to understand what it is, and then look for supplementary items through item relationships.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00006KJPV, title]
Observation 14: The title feature of B00006KJPV are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The title feature appears to be HTML code rather than a readable title. This suggests the data might be malformed or incomplete. Let me check other features of this item to better understand what it is, particularly the description or category.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00006KJPV, description]
Observation 15: The description feature of B00006KJPV are: ["<i>Jezebel</i> is the premiere guide to upscale, luxury living in Atlanta and beyond. Every month features the city's best restaurants, homes, fashion, shopping, events and culture. <i>Jezebel</I> highlights the city's most active and affluent residents and visitors alike.
