Question: Can you name the item which has over 4 shared purchase items with Sakkas Lightweight Two Tone Paisley Design Pashmina Fringe Scarf / Stole / Wrap?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you name the item which has over 4 shared purchase items with Sakkas Lightweight Two Tone Paisley Design Pashmina Fringe Scarf / Stole / Wrap? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for items that share more than 4 purchased items (likely also_bought_item or bought_together_item neighbors) with the item "Sakkas Lightweight Two Tone Paisley Design Pashmina Fringe Scarf / Stole / Wrap". First, I need to find this item node.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Sakkas Lightweight Two Tone Paisley Design Pashmina Fringe Scarf / Stole / Wrap]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find items that share over 4 purchased items with this node. I should first check what purchased item relationships exist. The graph has also_bought_item and bought_together_item relationships. I'll start by examining the also_bought_item neighbors of this item.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00007J82Z, also_bought_item]
Observation 2: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00007J82Z are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The also_bought_item neighbors list is empty. Let me check the bought_together_item neighbors instead, as that might be the "shared purchase items" relationship referred to in the question.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00007J82Z, bought_together_item]
Observation 3: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00007J82Z are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Both also_bought_item and bought_together_item neighbors are empty for this item. Let me check if there are any other purchase-related relationships. The question mentions "shared purchase items," which might refer to items that are commonly purchased together. Since the direct relationships are empty, I should check the brand relationship or consider if there's another interpretation. Alternatively, I might need to look at the item's category or other features to find similar items. Let me first check the brand of this item to see if other items from the same brand might share purchase patterns.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B00007J82Z, brand]
Observation 4: The brand neighbors of B00007J82Z are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The brand neighbors list is also empty. This suggests that the item node might not have direct relationships. Let me check the node features to verify the item and see if there's any information that could help. I should look at the title, category, or other features to confirm the node.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00007J82Z, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00007J82Z are: Sew Beautiful. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieved node has title "Sew Beautiful", which doesn't match the query "Sakkas Lightweight Two Tone Paisley Design Pashmina Fringe Scarf / Stole / Wrap". It seems the initial retrieval might have been incorrect. I need to retrieve the correct node for the given item title.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Sakkas Lightweight Two Tone Paisley Design Pashmina Fringe Scarf / Stole / Wrap]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieval is still returning the same node ID with a different title. This suggests that the graph might have inconsistencies or the item might be listed under a different title. Let me try to retrieve using a partial keyword or check if there are other nodes with similar titles. Alternatively, I can look for nodes that have "Sakkas" in their title.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Sakkas]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_507.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I retrieved a brand node instead of an item node. Let me try to retrieve the specific item with a more precise query or check the brand's items to find the correct item node.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[brand_507, item]
Observation 8: The item neighbors of brand_507 are: ['B00007J85I']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I found one item node associated with the Sakkas brand. Let me check its title to see if it matches the query.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00007J85I, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B00007J85I are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The title feature seems to be returning HTML code instead of the actual title. This might be a data issue. Let me try to retrieve the item using a different approach or check if there are other nodes with "Sakkas" in their features. Alternatively, I can search for "Pashmina" or "Scarf" to find relevant items.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Pashmina]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_412.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when searching for keywords. Let me try a different approach. I should search for the specific item title more carefully. Perhaps the title in the graph is stored differently. Let me try to retrieve with "Lightweight Two Tone Paisley" which might be more unique.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Lightweight Two Tone Paisley]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007AVIC.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I retrieved a node with ID B00007AVIC. Let me check its title to see if it matches the query item.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00007AVIC, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B00007AVIC are: Australian Patchwork &amp; Quilting. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The retrieved node still doesn't match the target item. Let me try a different approach. Since the direct retrieval isn't working, I should look for items that might be related to scarves or pashminas and then check their titles. Let me search for "Scarf" to find potential items.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Scarf]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000F3UPN4.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I retrieved a node with ID B000F3UPN4 when searching for "Scarf". Let me check its title to see if it's the target item or related.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B000F3UPN4, title]
Observation 14: The title feature of B000F3UPN4 are: Rivet. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm having difficulty finding the exact item node for "Sakkas Lightweight Two Tone Paisley Design Pashmina Fringe Scarf / Stole / Wrap". Let me try a different approach. Since the question is about shared purchase items, I should look for items that have bought_together_item relationships and then check if any share more than 4 items with others. However, without the specific item, this is challenging. Let me try to search for "Pashmina Fringe" which might be more specific.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Pashmina Fringe]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Correct answer: Sakkas Lightweight Two Tone Paisley Design Pashmina Fringe Scarf / Stole / Wrap, Sakkas Lightweight Two Tone Paisley Design Pashmina Fringe Scarf / Stole / Wrap, Sakkas Lightweight Two Tone Paisley Design Pashmina Fringe Scarf / Stole / Wrap
