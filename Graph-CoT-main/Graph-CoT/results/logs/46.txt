Question: How many buy-after-viewing items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many buy-after-viewing items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of buy-after-viewing items for an item with a specific title. However, the title provided appears to be HTML/CSS code ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"") rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the node using this title string as it appears in the question.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00005N7NQ), I need to find out how many buy-after-viewing items this item has. I should use the NodeDegree function to count the number of buy_after_viewing_item neighbors.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 2: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 0. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that this item has 0 buy_after_viewing_item neighbors. However, the question asks to provide the answer using node main features (names) rather than just the count. Since there are no buy-after-viewing items, I should confirm this by checking the neighbors directly to ensure there are indeed none.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 3: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The neighbor check confirms that there are no buy_after_viewing_item neighbors for this item. Since the count is 0 and there are no specific items to list by name, the answer should simply be 0. However, I should verify that I have the correct item node by checking its title feature to ensure the retrieval was accurate.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The node feature confirms that I have the correct item node, as the title matches exactly what was provided in the question. Since there are no buy_after_viewing_item neighbors (count is 0), and the question asks to provide node main features (names) for the answer, but there are no such items to name, the appropriate answer is simply 0.
Action 5: Finish[0]
Observation 5: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 0
