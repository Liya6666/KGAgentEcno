Question: Under which category is the item Little-Known Museums in and Around Rome classified?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Under which category is the item Little-Known Museums in and Around Rome classified? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the category of an item node called "Little-Known Museums in and Around Rome". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Little-Known Museums in and Around Rome]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_711.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_711" as the node ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should verify if this is indeed the correct node by checking its features to confirm it's an item node.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_711, name]
Observation 2: The name feature of brand_711 are: Archaeological Institute of America. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The node brand_711 is clearly a brand node (Archaeological Institute of America), not the item "Little-Known Museums in and Around Rome". I need to retrieve the correct item node. Perhaps the title was slightly different in the graph. I should try a more specific or alternative search.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Little-Known Museums in and Around Rome item]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_711.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node instead of the item node. This suggests that the exact title "Little-Known Museums in and Around Rome" might not match the item node's title feature exactly. I should try to retrieve nodes with partial keywords that are more likely to be unique to this item, such as "Museums in and Around Rome" or try to find the item through other means.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Museums in and Around Rome]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_711.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval is still returning the brand node. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with these keywords, or there might be an issue with the retrieval function. Since the question is about an item, I should try to find items related to this brand that might include the target item, or try a different approach. Perhaps I can look for items with "Little-Known Museums" in their title through the brand's items.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[brand_711, name]
Observation 5: The name feature of brand_711 are: Archaeological Institute of America. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: Since the retrieval is consistently returning a brand node instead of the item, I need to try a different approach. The item "Little-Known Museums in and Around Rome" might be associated with this brand (Archaeological Institute of America). I can check what items are linked to this brand node, and then look for the specific item among them.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[brand_711, item]
Observation 6: The item neighbors of brand_711 are: ['B000FTJ7BE']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: Now I have an item node ID 'B000FTJ7BE' that belongs to the brand Archaeological Institute of America. I should check if this is the correct item by examining its title feature to confirm it matches "Little-Known Museums in and Around Rome".
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B000FTJ7BE, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B000FTJ7BE are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The title feature returned HTML code instead of the actual title text. This suggests the feature might be stored with HTML formatting. I need to check if this is indeed the correct item by looking at other features or trying to find the exact title match. Since the question is about "Little-Known Museums in and Around Rome", I should try to retrieve the item with a more precise query or check if this item's description contains the relevant keywords.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B000FTJ7BE, description]

This suggests that the item node B000FTJ7BE is not the correct item. I need to find the correct item node. Since the retrieval function is not working as expected with the title, I should try to search for the item using different keywords or try to find it through category searches if possible. However, the available functions don't support searching by category directly. I should try a more specific retrieval query.
