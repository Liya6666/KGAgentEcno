Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted with HTML tags ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?"). I need to first retrieve the correct item node using the available title information.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have retrieved the item node with ID B00005N7NQ. Now I need to get the price feature of this item node to answer the question.
Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, price]
Observation 2: The price feature of B00005N7NQ are: . 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The price feature appears to be empty or missing for this node. I should check if I have the correct node by verifying its title feature to ensure the retrieval was accurate.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title feature confirms that this is indeed the correct node, but the price feature appears to be empty. I should check if there are any alternative ways to get price information, such as checking related items that might have similar pricing, or verifying if there are other features that might contain price information. Let me first check the category and description features to see if they contain any price-related information.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 4: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The category information doesn't provide price details. Let me check the description feature to see if it contains any price information.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 5: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The description feature also doesn't contain price information. Since this is a magazine subscription item, the price might be variable or not available in the standard price field. Let me check if there are any related items (also_viewed, also_bought, etc.) that might have price information, which could give me an indication of the price range for this type of item.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 6: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I have a list of also_viewed_item neighbors. I can check the price of one of these related items to get an idea of the price range for this type of magazine subscription. Let me start by checking the price of the first neighbor in the list.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, price]
Observation 7: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 8: Thought 8: The error suggests that the node B000UHI2LW might not exist or the price feature might not be available for it. Let me try checking the price feature for a different also_viewed_item neighbor. I'll try the second one in the list.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B002PXW18E, price]
Observation 8: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 9: Thought 9: It seems that the also_viewed_item neighbors might not have price features available, or these nodes might not exist in the graph. Let me try a different approach. I should check if the item has any brand information, as sometimes brand nodes might have pricing information or I could check other relationship types like also_bought_item or bought_together_item.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 9: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I have found that the item is linked to a brand node 'brand_0'. Let me check the brand node's features to see if it contains any pricing information, though typically brand nodes only have name features according to the graph definition.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 10: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The brand name is "Reason Magazine", but brand nodes only have name features according to the graph definition, so they won't contain price information. Let me try checking other relationship types for the original item node. I'll check the also_bought_item neighbors to see if they have price information that might be relevant.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 11: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I have a list of also_bought_item neighbors. Let me try checking the price feature for one of these related items. I'll start with the first neighbor in the list.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B01MCU84LB, price]
Observation 12: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm encountering issues retrieving price information for related items. Let me try a different approach. Since the original item's price feature appears to be empty, I should check if there might be an issue with how I'm querying the price feature. Let me try checking the price feature for the original item again, but this time I'll be more specific about the feature name.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, price]
Observation 13: The price feature of B00005N7NQ are: . 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The price feature is indeed empty for this item. Given that this is a magazine subscription item, it's possible that the price is not fixed or available in the standard price field. Since I cannot find the price directly from the item node or its related items, I should conclude that the price information is not available in the graph for this specific item.
Action 14: Finish[Price information not available]
Observation 14: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: .a-box-inner{background-color:#fff}#alohaBuyBoxWidget .selected{background-color:#fffbf3;border-color:#e77600;box-shadow:0 0 3px rgba(228,121,17,.5)}#alohaBuyBoxWidget .contract-not-available{color:gray}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-cart{height:auto;overflow:hidden}#aloha-cart-popover #aloha-cartInfo{float:left}#aloha-cart-popover #aloha-cart-details{float:right;margin-top:1em}#aloha-cart-popover .deviceContainer{width:160px;float:left;padding-right:10px;border-right:1px solid #ddd}#aloha-cart-popover li:last-child{border-right:0}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-device-title{height:3em;overflow:hidden}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-thumbnail-container{height:100px;margin-bottom:1em;text-align:center}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-price-container{text-align:center}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-thumbnail-container img{height:inherit}#aloha-cart-popover .aloha-cart{border-top:1px solid #ddd;border-bottom:1px solid #ddd}#aloha-cart-popover #aloha-cart-info{margin-right:0}#alohaBuyBoxWidget .without-contract-subheading{margin-right:0}#aloha-bb-help-nodes .aloha-bb-contract-term-heading{color:gray;font-family:arial;margin-top:.5em;text-align:center;height:.7em;border-bottom:1px solid gray;margin-bottom:1.6em}#aloha-bb-help-nodes .aloha-bb-contract-term-heading span{background-color:#fff;padding:0 10px 0 10px}#alohaAvailabilityUS_feature_div .availability a{text-decoration:none}#alohaPricingWidget a{text-decoration:none}#alohaAvailabilityUS_feature_div .availability{margin-top:-4px;margin-bottom:0}#alohaBuyBoxWidget .select-transaction-alert .a-icon-alert{top:18px;left:3px}#alohaBuyBoxWidget .select-transaction-alert .a-alert-container{padding-left:39px;width:290px}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div #alohaBuyBoxWidget .contract-container .contract-term-heading a{text-decoration:none}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div #alohaBuyBoxWidget .annual-contract-box .a-icon-popover{display:none}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div #alohaBuyBoxWidget .contract-container .annual-contract-box{cursor:pointer;cursor:hand}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div #alohaBuyBoxWidget .aloha-buybox-price{font-size:15px}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div #alohaBuyBoxWidget #linkOffSection a{text-decoration:none}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div .lockedUsedBuyboxContainer{padding-left:3.5%}#alohaBuyBoxUS_feature_div .alohaBuyboxUtilsNoWrap{white-space:nowrap}.hidden{display:none}.simo-no-padding{padding:0}.carrier-reviews-cell{padding-left:10px}.carrier-reviews-bordered-cell{border:1px dotted #ccc}.carrier-reviews-selected-cell{background-color:#ffd}#aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-description{margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:14px}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-sortable-header.carrier{min-width:97px}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-sortable-header.compatibility{min-width:156px}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-sortable-header div{float:left}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-sortable-header i.a-icon{margin-left:10px;margin-top:4px}#aloha-carrier-compatibility-overview-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes td:nth-child(2n),#aloha-carrier-compatibility-overview-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes th:nth-child(2n){background-color:initial}#aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes td:nth-child(2n),#aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes th:nth-child(2n){background-color:initial}#aloha-carrier-compatibility-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes th:nth-child(2n),.aloha-carrier-compatibility-table.a-bordered.a-vertical-stripes td:nth-child(2n){background-color:transparent}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-column-gray{background-color:#f6f6f6}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .aloha-carrier-compatibility-tech-text,.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .carrier-name,.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .carrier-rating-summary{min-height:27px;display:inline-block;cursor:default}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .aloha-carrier-compatibility-tech-text:first-line,.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .carrier-name:first-line,.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .carrier-rating-summary:first-line{line-height:27px}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-modal-table-row .aloha-carrier-compatibility-icon{margin-top:6px}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-check-icon{width:30px;height:27px;background-position:-318px -35px;background-image:url(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/AUIClients/AmazonUIBaseCSS-sprite_2x-8e7ef370dc28a214b3f490c9620f4ac501d5a864._V2_.png);background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:400px 650px;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top}.aloha-carrier-compatibility-hidden{display:none}.aloha-buybox-spaced-link{margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:7px;text-align:center}.popover-tab
