Question: Search for other items under the same brand and category as Truper 32408 Mega Wood Splitting Wedge, Drop Forged, 5-Pound.
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Search for other items under the same brand and category as Truper 32408 Mega Wood Splitting Wedge, Drop Forged, 5-Pound. Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for other items under the same brand and category as "Truper 32408 Mega Wood Splitting Wedge, Drop Forged, 5-Pound". First, I need to find this item node in the graph to get its brand and category.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Truper 32408 Mega Wood Splitting Wedge, Drop Forged, 5-Pound]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_361.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned a brand node (brand_361) instead of an item node. This suggests that the retrieval might have matched a brand name rather than the item title. I need to be more specific with my retrieval to find the actual item node.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Truper 32408 Mega Wood Splitting Wedge, Drop Forged, 5-Pound item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_361.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is still returning a brand node instead of the item. This suggests that the item title might not be an exact match in the graph, or there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the item by using a more specific keyword or part of the title.
Action 3: RetrieveNode[Truper 32408 Mega Wood Splitting Wedge]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_361.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval is consistently returning brand_361, which suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable by its full title. Perhaps the item node has a different title or the retrieval function is matching the brand name "Truper" instead. Let me try to retrieve the brand node first to see if it has the item, or use a different approach.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Truper]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_821.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I see that retrieving "Truper" gives brand_821, which is different from the previous brand_361. This suggests there might be multiple brands with similar names or the retrieval is inconsistent. Let me try to retrieve the item using a different part of the title, perhaps focusing on the product code or a unique phrase.
