Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"']?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"']? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a recommendation based on a user's history, but the history provided appears to be HTML/CSS class names rather than actual item identifiers. I need to clarify what these represent in the graph context. Since these are not standard item titles or IDs, I should first try to retrieve nodes using these strings to see if they correspond to any items in the graph.

Thought 2: Thought 1: The user's history appears to contain HTML/CSS class names rather than actual item identifiers. These might be formatting elements rather than meaningful item data. I need to check if these strings correspond to any nodes in the graph, but they seem unlikely to be valid item titles or IDs based on the pattern.
