Question: How many also-bought items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many also-bought items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the number of also-bought items for a specific item, but the item name appears to be incomplete or possibly corrupted (it looks like HTML/CSS class names rather than a proper product title). I need to first identify the correct item node. Since the given "name" doesn't seem like a valid product title, I should try to retrieve the node anyway to see if it exists, or perhaps this is a placeholder that needs clarification.
Action 1: Thought 1: The item name provided appears to be HTML/CSS code ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"") rather than a proper product title. This seems like it might be an error in the question formatting. I should attempt to retrieve the node using this exact string to see if it exists in the graph, but it's unlikely to match a real product title.
Observation 1:

Thought 6: Thought 1: The item name provided appears to be HTML/CSS code ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"") rather than a proper product title. This seems like it might be an error in the question formatting. However, I should attempt to retrieve the node using this exact string to see if it exists in the graph.
Action 6: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I successfully retrieved a node with ID B00005N7NQ using the given string. Now I need to verify that this is indeed the correct item node by checking its title feature to confirm it matches the query.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The node's title feature matches exactly with the given string in the question. Now I need to find the number of also_bought_item neighbors for this item node. The question asks for the count of also-bought items.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 8: The also_bought_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 38. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I have found that the item has 38 also_bought_item neighbors. The question asks to provide the answer using node main features (names) rather than node IDs, but since the question specifically asks for the count (how many), the answer should simply be the number 38.
Action 9: Action 9: Finish[38]
Observation 9: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 0
