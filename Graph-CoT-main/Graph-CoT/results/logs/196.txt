Question: Can you name the complementary item for this query: corsair hs50?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you name the complementary item for this query: corsair hs50? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a "complementary item" for the item "corsair hs50". I need to understand what "complementary" means in this context. Looking at the available relationships for an item node, potential complementary relationships could be "also_bought_item" or "bought_together_item". I should first retrieve the node for "corsair hs50".
Action 1: RetrieveNode[corsair hs50]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_518.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation shows that "corsair hs50" corresponds to a brand node (brand_518), not an item node. The question asks for a complementary item for this query. Since it's a brand, I should first find items associated with this brand, then look for complementary relationships among those items or from a representative item.
Action 2: Thought 2: Since "corsair hs50" is a brand node, I need to find items associated with this brand first. Then I can look for complementary relationships from one of those items. Let me get the items linked to this brand.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to find the items associated with the brand "corsair hs50" (brand_518). I can use the NeighbourCheck function to list all item nodes linked to this brand.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_518, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_518 are: ['B00007KZXF']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now I have one item node (B00007KZXF) associated with the brand "corsair hs50". To find a complementary item, I should check the complementary relationships for this item node. The most relevant relationships for "complementary" would likely be "bought_together_item" or "also_bought_item". Let me first check what this item is by getting its title feature.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00007KZXF, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00007KZXF are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature seems to be returning HTML code instead of the actual title. This might be an issue with the data. Let me try to get other features or proceed with checking complementary relationships directly. I should check the "bought_together_item" or "also_bought_item" relationships for this item node to find complementary items.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00007KZXF, bought_together_item]
Observation 5: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00007KZXF are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The bought_together_item relationship returned an empty list. Let me try the also_bought_item relationship, which might also indicate complementary items.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00007KZXF, also_bought_item]
Observation 6: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00007KZXF are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: Both complementary relationships returned empty lists. Let me try other relationships like "also_viewed_item" or "buy_after_viewing_item" which might also provide relevant complementary items. I'll start with "also_viewed_item".
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[B00007KZXF, also_viewed_item]
Observation 7: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00007KZXF are: []. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: All complementary relationships for the item B00007KZXF are returning empty lists. Let me try the "buy_after_viewing_item" relationship as another potential source of complementary items.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[B00007KZXF, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 8: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00007KZXF are: []. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: All complementary relationships for the item B00007KZXF are empty. Since "corsair hs50" is a brand, perhaps I should check if there are more items associated with this brand. The initial NeighbourCheck only returned one item, but maybe I need to verify if there are others. Let me also check the NodeDegree for the brand to see how many items it has.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeDegree[brand_518, item]
Observation 9: The item neighbor node degree of brand_518 are: 1. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The brand "corsair hs50" only has one associated item (B00007KZXF), and that item has no complementary relationships. However, the question specifically asks for a complementary item. Perhaps I should check if there are other items from the same brand that might be complementary, but since there's only one item, this isn't possible. Alternatively, maybe I should look at complementary relationships from the brand perspective or consider that "corsair hs50" might be an item title rather than a brand name. Let me try retrieving it as an item node instead.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Corsair HS50]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_518.
Thought 11: Thought 11: The retrieval still returns a brand node. Let me try searching with variations of the query or check if there might be an item with a similar name. Perhaps I should search for items that contain "corsair hs50" in their title. Let me try retrieving with a partial match or check if there are items with "Corsair" in the title.
Action 11: Thought 11: Since "corsair hs50" consistently retrieves as a brand node, and the associated item has no complementary relationships, I need to try a different approach. Perhaps there's an item with "Corsair HS50" in its title that I haven't found yet. Let me try retrieving with "Corsair HS50" (capitalized) or search for items containing "Corsair" to see if there's a relevant item node.
Observation 11: 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I need to try retrieving an item node with "Corsair HS50" in its title. Since the previous retrievals returned a brand node, perhaps I should search for items containing "Corsair" to find the correct item node. Let me try retrieving with "Corsair" as a keyword.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[Corsair]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_518.
Thought 13: Thought 13: The retrieval for "Corsair" also returns the brand node. This suggests that "Corsair" is primarily recognized as a brand in this graph. However, the question specifically asks for a complementary item for "corsair hs50", which appears to be a product model. Perhaps I need to find an item node that has "HS50" in its title. Let me try retrieving with "HS50" as a keyword.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[HS50]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_575.
Thought 14: Thought 14: Retrieving "HS50" also returns a brand node (brand_575), not an item node. This suggests that in this graph, product models like "HS50" might be represented as brands rather than items. Since I cannot find a specific item node for "corsair hs50", and the brand node has only one associated item with no complementary relationships, I need to reconsider the approach. Perhaps I should look for complementary items based on the category or other features of the item B00007KZXF. Let me first get more information about this item, such as its category, to see if I can find complementary items from the same category.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00007KZXF, category]
Observation 14: The category feature of B00007KZXF are: []. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The category feature is empty for this item. Let me try to get the description feature to better understand what this item is, which might help me find complementary items.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00007KZXF, description]
Observation 15: The description feature of B00007KZXF are: ['Pipes and Tobaccos is a quarterly publication dedicated to the celebration of pipe collecting, tobacco, and all things related to the hobby of pipe smoking. It contains stories on growing and blending tobacco, pipemakers, collectors, and celebrity pipe smokers as well as a variety of helpful hints.', '', ''].
