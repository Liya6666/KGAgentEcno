Question: What count of buy-after-viewing items does Men and Angels have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What count of buy-after-viewing items does Men and Angels have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the count of buy-after-viewing items for the item "Men and Angels". First, I need to find the node for this item in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Men and Angels]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00JVS7OTC.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the node ID for "Men and Angels". The question is asking for the count of buy-after-viewing items, but specifically requesting the main features (names) of those items rather than just a count. I need to first find all the buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of this node.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00JVS7OTC, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 2: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00JVS7OTC are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that there are no buy_after_viewing_item neighbors for this item. This means the count is 0, and there are no items to list by name. I should confirm this by checking the node degree for buy_after_viewing_item to ensure accuracy.
Action 3: NodeDegree[B00JVS7OTC, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 3: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbor node degree of B00JVS7OTC are: 0. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Both the neighbor check and node degree confirm that there are no buy-after-viewing items for "Men and Angels". Therefore, the count is 0, and there are no item names to provide.
Action 4: Finish[0]
Observation 4: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 0
