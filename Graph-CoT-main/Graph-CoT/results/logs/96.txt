Question: Which thing has over 4 joint views with Cleto Reyes Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain - Red?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which thing has over 4 joint views with Cleto Reyes Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain - Red? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for items that have over 4 joint views with "Cleto Reyes Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain - Red". This likely means I need to find items that share more than 4 also_viewed_item neighbors with this item. First, I need to find the node for "Cleto Reyes Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain - Red".
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[Cleto Reyes Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain - Red]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_173.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_173" as the ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the item node again, perhaps with a more precise query.
Action 2: Action 2: RetrieveNode[Cleto Reyes Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain - Red item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_46.
Thought 3: Thought 3: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of an item node. This suggests that the retrieval might be matching the brand name rather than the item title. Let me try to be more specific by including more of the item title or using a different approach. Perhaps I should look for items that contain the keywords "Cleto Reyes" and "Boxing Glove Keychain" to find the correct item node.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Cleto Reyes Boxing Glove Keychain Red]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_888.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of the item node. This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand matches. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I should search for items with "Boxing Glove Keychain" to see if I can find the correct item node.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Boxing Glove Keychain]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_888.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. This suggests that the graph might not have the exact item node I'm looking for, or the retrieval function is not working as expected for this specific item. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I should look for items that might be related to boxing or keychains to see if I can find the correct item node indirectly.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Cleto Reyes Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_173.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of the item node, which suggests that either the item doesn't exist in the graph or the retrieval function is not working properly for this specific query. Since the question asks about "joint views" with this item, I need to find the actual item node. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for "Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain" without the brand name to see if I can find any relevant items.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00K05O272.
Thought 7: Thought 7: Great! Now I have an item node ID: B00K05O272. Let me verify that this is indeed the correct item by checking its title feature.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00K05O272, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B00K05O272 are: Lego Club Magazine May-june 2014. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The retrieved node B00K05O272 has the title "Lego Club Magazine May-june 2014", which doesn't match "Cleto Reyes Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain - Red". This suggests that the retrieval is still not finding the correct item. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for "Cleto Reyes" to find the brand node first, then look for its items.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Cleto Reyes]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_336.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I found a brand node for "Cleto Reyes" (brand_336). Now I can get all items linked to this brand to find the specific item "Cleto Reyes Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain - Red".
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[brand_336, item]
Observation 9: The item neighbors of brand_336 are: ['B00006KOQ4']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I found that brand_336 has only one item: B00006KOQ4. Let me check the title of this item to see if it matches "Cleto Reyes Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain - Red".
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00006KOQ4, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B00006KOQ4 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The title feature seems to be returning HTML code instead of the actual title. This might be an issue with the graph data. Let me try to retrieve the item node again with a more specific query that includes the full item name.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Cleto Reyes Plastic Boxing Glove Keychain - Red item node]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_46.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm still having trouble retrieving the correct item node. Let me try a different approach. Since the question is about "joint views" (likely meaning shared also_viewed_item neighbors), I need to find items that share more than 4 also_viewed_item neighbors with the target item. However, without the correct item node, I can't proceed. Let me try to search for items with "Boxing Glove Keychain" to see if I can find any relevant items that might be the one I'm looking for or related to it.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[Boxing Glove Keychain Red]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_888.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the specific item, which suggests that either the item doesn't exist in the graph or there's an issue with the retrieval function. However, the question is asking about items that have over 4 joint views with this specific item, so I need to find a way to identify the correct item node. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for items that might be related to boxing or keychains to see if I can find any items that could be the target or similar to it.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Boxing Keychain]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000F3UPN4.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I retrieved an item node B000F3UPN4 with "Boxing Keychain". Let me check its title to see if it's relevant to the target item.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B000F3UPN4, title]
Observation 14: The title feature of B000F3UPN4 are: Rivet. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The title "Rivet" doesn't seem to match "Boxing Keychain". This suggests that the retrieval might not be working as expected. Given the persistent issues in retrieving the exact item node, I should consider that the target item might not be in the graph, or there might be a data issue. However, the question is about finding items with over 4 joint views with this item, so I need to proceed with the available information. Since I cannot retrieve the exact item, I might need to assume that the item exists and has an ID, or perhaps the question refers to a different item. Let me try to retrieve the item using a different keyword or consider that the item might be listed under a different name.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Cleto Reyes Boxing Glove]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_888.
Correct answer: Ringside Small Boxing Glove Keyring, Ringside Boxing Glove Key Ring
