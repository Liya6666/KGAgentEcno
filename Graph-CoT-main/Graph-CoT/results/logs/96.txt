Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item with a specific title containing HTML-like text: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". I need to find this item node in the graph first.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00005N7NQ), I need to understand what "format" means in this context. Since the question asks for the main feature rather than node IDs, and mentions "names", I should check the item's features. The available features for items are title, description, price, img, and category. "Format" might refer to the category or possibly the description. Let me first check the category feature.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 2: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The category feature provides multiple categories, but the question specifically asks for "format". In the context of items like magazines or journals, "format" might refer to the physical/digital format (e.g., print, digital, etc.). Since the category doesn't clearly indicate format, I should check the description feature, which might contain details about the format.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 3: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The description provides content details but doesn't explicitly mention the format. Since this appears to be a magazine/journal item, "format" might refer to whether it's a print subscription, digital, etc. Let me check the title feature, as it might contain format information, or I should consider if there are other relevant features. The available features are title, description, price, img, and category. Perhaps I should check the title feature to see if it contains format information.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature appears to be the exact HTML-like text from the question. This suggests that "format" might be referring to the actual format of the item title itself, which contains HTML markup. Since the question asks for "format" and mentions providing node main features rather than IDs, and the title contains HTML formatting, the format could be "HTML" or "HTML-formatted". However, I should verify if there are other interpretations. Let me check if there are any neighbors or other features that might indicate format. Since this is a magazine/journal item, I could check if it has brand neighbors that might indicate format.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 5: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I have the brand node ID. Let me check the brand name to see if it provides any format information.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 6: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The brand name is "Reason Magazine", which confirms this is a magazine item. However, this doesn't directly answer the "format" question. Given that the title feature contains HTML markup ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"") and the question specifically asks about the format of the item, I believe "format" refers to the HTML formatting in the title. The main feature that demonstrates this format is the title itself, which contains HTML markup.
Action 7: Finish[HTML-formatted title]
Observation 7: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Print Magazine
