Question: Can you identify the item that exactly matches this query: royal blue necklace?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you identify the item that exactly matches this query: royal blue necklace? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking to identify an item node that exactly matches the query "royal blue necklace". I need to find the node in the graph that has "royal blue necklace" as its title or perhaps in its description. Since it says "exactly matches", it's likely referring to the title feature. I should retrieve the node using the query as a keyword.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[royal blue necklace]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_172.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned a brand node (brand_172) instead of an item node. This suggests that "royal blue necklace" might be a brand name rather than an item title. However, the question specifically asks for an "item" that matches the query. I should check the features of this brand node to confirm what it represents, and then look for items associated with this brand.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_172, name]
Observation 2: The name feature of brand_172 are: Passion Beauty. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The brand node's name is "Passion Beauty", not "royal blue necklace". This indicates that my initial retrieval might have been incorrect or that "royal blue necklace" is not a direct match for a node title. Since the question asks for an item that exactly matches "royal blue necklace", I should try to search more specifically. Perhaps I need to look for items where the title exactly contains "royal blue necklace". Alternatively, I should check if there are any item nodes linked to this brand that might have "royal blue necklace" in their title or description.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_172, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_172 are: ['B00006K5XN', 'B00006KS44']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have two item nodes associated with brand_172. I need to check the features of these items to see if any of them have "royal blue necklace" in their title. Since the question asks for an exact match, I should look for an item where the title is exactly "royal blue necklace" or contains it as the main part.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00006K5XN, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00006K5XN are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than the actual title text. This suggests there might be an issue with how the feature is stored or retrieved. I should try retrieving the node using a different approach or check if "royal blue necklace" appears in other features like description. Alternatively, I should try the other item node from the brand.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00006KS44, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00006KS44 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: Both item nodes returned HTML code instead of readable titles, which suggests the title feature might be stored in a different format or there's an issue with the retrieval. Since the question asks for an exact match to "royal blue necklace", I should try a different approach. Perhaps I need to search for items more directly using the exact phrase. Let me try retrieving the node again but with a more precise query or check if there are other nodes that might match.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode["Royal Blue Necklace"]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_172.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm still getting brand_172 when searching for "Royal Blue Necklace". This suggests that "royal blue necklace" might be associated with the brand name rather than item titles. However, the question specifically asks for an "item" that exactly matches "royal blue necklace". Let me try a different approach - perhaps I should search for items that have "royal blue necklace" in their description feature instead of title, or maybe I need to look at the category feature.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[item royal blue necklace]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_395.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying different search queries. This suggests that "royal blue necklace" might not be an exact title match for any item node. Since the question asks for an exact match, I should try to search more systematically. Perhaps I need to look at the category feature of items or try to find items that have "royal blue necklace" as part of their description. Let me try retrieving the node with just "necklace" to see if I can find relevant items and then check their features.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[necklace]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_555.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when searching for "royal blue necklace" or related terms. This suggests that the graph might not have an item with "royal blue necklace" as its exact title. However, the question specifically asks for an item that exactly matches "royal blue necklace". Let me try a different approach - perhaps I need to search for items more broadly and then check their features individually. Since the RetrieveNode function seems to be returning brand nodes for these queries, maybe I should try searching with the exact phrase in quotes or try to find items through their category or description features.
Action 9: Thought 9: The RetrieveNode function seems to consistently return brand nodes when I search for "royal blue necklace" or related terms. This suggests that either there is no item with "royal blue necklace" as its exact title, or I need to search differently. Since the question asks for an exact match, I should try to search for items that might have this phrase in their description or category features. Let me try searching for "royal blue" to see if I can find relevant items and then check their features more carefully.
Observation 9: 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when searching for "royal blue necklace" or related terms. This suggests that the graph might not have an item with "royal blue necklace" as its exact title. However, the question specifically asks for an item that exactly matches "royal blue necklace". Let me try a different approach - perhaps I need to search for items more broadly and then check their features individually. Since the RetrieveNode function seems to be returning brand nodes for these queries, maybe I should try searching with the exact phrase in quotes or try to find items through their category or description features.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode["royal blue necklace" item]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_395.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when searching for "royal blue necklace" in various ways. This strongly suggests that there is no item node with "royal blue necklace" as its exact title in the graph. The RetrieveNode function appears to be matching brand names rather than item titles. Since the question asks for an exact match and I cannot find any item node with this exact title, I should conclude that no such item exists in the graph.
Action 11: Thought 11: Since multiple attempts to retrieve an item node with "royal blue necklace" as the title have consistently returned brand nodes instead, it appears that there is no item in the graph that exactly matches "royal blue necklace" as its title. The question specifically asks for an exact match, so I should conclude that no such item exists.
Observation 11: 
Thought 12: Thought 12: Based on my repeated attempts to retrieve an item node with "royal blue necklace" as an exact match, I consistently received brand nodes instead. This indicates that there is no item in the graph with "royal blue necklace" as its exact title. Since the question asks for an exact match and I cannot find any such item node, I should conclude that no item exactly matches this query.
Action 12: Action 12: Finish[No item exactly matches "royal blue necklace" in the graph]
Observation 12: Answer is INCORRECT
