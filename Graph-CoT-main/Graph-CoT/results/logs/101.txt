Question: Which product has more than 4 items commonly purchased with the item Doo Gro Stimulating Growth Oil?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which product has more than 4 items commonly purchased with the item Doo Gro Stimulating Growth Oil? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items that have more than 4 "bought_together_item" relationships with the item "Doo Gro Stimulating Growth Oil". First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Doo Gro Stimulating Growth Oil]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7RP.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find all the "bought_together_item" neighbors of this item to see what items are commonly purchased with it.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7RP, bought_together_item]
Observation 2: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00005N7RP are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the item "Doo Gro Stimulating Growth Oil" has no bought_together_item neighbors. This suggests that perhaps the relationship might be stored differently, or maybe I need to consider other relationship types. Let me check if there are other types of relationships for this item, such as also_bought_item, which might represent items commonly purchased together.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7RP, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7RP are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: It seems this item has no also_bought_item neighbors either. Let me check what relationships this item actually has by examining its node features and available neighbor types.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7RP, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00005N7RP are: Natural Health. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature doesn't seem to match the expected item name. Let me verify if I have the correct node by checking other features or trying a different retrieval approach. The item name might be slightly different in the graph.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Doo Gro Stimulating Growth Oil Natural Health]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7RP.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieval confirms that B00005N7RP is indeed the node for "Doo Gro Stimulating Growth Oil" (with "Natural Health" as part of its title). Since it has no bought_together_item or also_bought_item neighbors, perhaps the question is about items that have this item as one of their bought_together_item neighbors with more than 4 such neighbors in total. In other words, I need to find items that include B00005N7RP in their bought_together_item list and have more than 4 bought_together_item neighbors overall.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7RP, reverse_bought_together_item] or check if there's a way to find nodes that have B00005N7RP as a bought_together_item neighbor.
Observation 6: The node or neighbor type does not exist in the graph. This might because your given neighbor type is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 7: Thought 7: Since the graph doesn't support reverse relationships directly, I need to think differently. Perhaps I should look at all items that have bought_together_item relationships and check if B00005N7RP is among their bought_together_item neighbors and if they have more than 4 such neighbors. However, this might be inefficient. Let me first check what relationships this item actually has by examining all its neighbor types.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeDegree[B00005N7RP, all]
Observation 7: The node or neighbor type does not exist in the graph. This might because your given neighbor type is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I need to check what types of neighbors this item has. Since the graph has specific relationship types, I should check each possible neighbor type for this item to understand its connections.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7RP, brand]
Observation 8: The brand neighbors of B00005N7RP are: []. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: It seems this item has no brand neighbors either. Let me check other relationship types like also_viewed_item and buy_after_viewing_item to understand what connections this item has.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7RP, also_viewed_item]
Observation 9: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7RP are: []. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: This item appears to have no relationships of any type in the graph. Let me verify the node ID by checking its title feature again to ensure we have the correct item.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00005N7RP, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B00005N7RP are: Natural Health. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The title "Natural Health" doesn't match "Doo Gro Stimulating Growth Oil". It seems I may have the wrong node. Let me try retrieving with a different approach - perhaps using a partial match or checking if there's another node with a more relevant title.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Doo Gro]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_486.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I retrieved "Doo Gro" and got a brand node (brand_486) instead of an item node. This suggests that "Doo Gro" might be a brand name. Let me check what items belong to this brand, as the original item might be among them.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[brand_486, item]
Observation 12: The item neighbors of brand_486 are: ['B00007EO1M', 'B000LC56B0', 'B001E54B14']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: Now I have three item nodes that belong to the Doo Gro brand. I need to find which one corresponds to "Doo Gro Stimulating Growth Oil". Let me check the title features of these items to identify the correct one.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00007EO1M, title]
Observation 13: The title feature of B00007EO1M are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The title feature seems to be returning HTML code instead of the actual title. This might be an issue with how the feature is stored. Let me try checking the title feature for the other items to see if I can find the correct one.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B000LC56B0, title]
Observation 14: The title feature of B000LC56B0 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The title features for these items are returning HTML code instead of readable text. This suggests that the title might be stored differently or there might be an issue with the feature extraction. Let me try checking the description feature instead, as it might contain the product name.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00007EO1M, description]
Observation 15: The description feature of B00007EO1M are: ["This monthly magazine covers all kinds of scale model aircraft - from state-of-the-art radio control, through control line, to free flight and even indoor. It's full of information on scale modelling techniques, all in full colour throughout.", '', ''].
