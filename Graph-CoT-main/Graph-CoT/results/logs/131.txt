Question: Which items from publisher Greenspring Media Group have the most also-viewed items?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which items from publisher Greenspring Media Group have the most also-viewed items? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items from a specific publisher (Greenspring Media Group). First, I need to identify if "publisher" refers to a brand in this graph context. Since brands have a "name" feature, and the publisher is mentioned by name, I should find the brand node for Greenspring Media Group.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Greenspring Media Group]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_308.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node (brand_308), I need to find all items linked to this brand. The question asks for items from this publisher that have the most also-viewed items. So I should first get all items from this brand, then for each item, determine the number of also_viewed_item neighbors, and finally identify which items have the highest count.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_308, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_308 are: ['B00006KO2Q']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I see that brand_308 (Greenspring Media Group) has only one item: B00006KO2Q. Now I need to check how many also_viewed_item neighbors this item has to determine if it has the most also-viewed items among items from this publisher.
Action 3: NodeDegree[B00006KO2Q, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00006KO2Q are: 4. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Since there is only one item (B00006KO2Q) from publisher Greenspring Media Group, it automatically has the most also-viewed items by default. Now I need to get the main feature (title) of this item to answer the question, rather than just providing the node ID.
Action 4: NodeFeature[B00006KO2Q, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00006KO2Q are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature returned appears to be HTML code rather than the actual title text. I need to retrieve the proper title information. Let me try getting the title feature again, or check if there's another way to get the item's name.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00006KO2Q, description]
Observation 5: The description feature of B00006KO2Q are: ['Explores vitality and variety of life, arts, and public affairs of upper Midwest. Also, includes a program guide for broadcast services of Minnesota public radio.']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The description feature doesn't give me the title. Let me try to get the title feature again, perhaps the previous response was incomplete or there's an issue with how the title is stored. I should also check if there are other features that might contain the item's name.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00006KO2Q, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00006KO2Q are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The title feature seems to be returning HTML code rather than the actual title text. This might be an issue with how the data is stored. Let me try to get the category feature or check if there's another way to identify the item's name. Alternatively, I could check if the description contains the title information.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00006KO2Q, category]
Observation 7: The category feature of B00006KO2Q are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Travel, City & Regional', 'United States', 'Midwest']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The category information doesn't give me the actual title. Since the title feature appears to be returning HTML code, I should try to extract the actual title from within that HTML or see if there's another approach. Let me check if the description might contain the title, or if I need to parse the HTML content.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00006KO2Q, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B00006KO2Q are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title feature consistently returns HTML code rather than plain text. This might be a data issue where the title is embedded in HTML. Let me try to get the full HTML content and see if I can extract the actual title from it, or check if there's another feature that contains the readable title. Alternatively, I could check if the description contains the title information.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00006KO2Q, img]
Observation 9: The img feature of B00006KO2Q are: . 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The img feature returned nothing. Let me try a different approach. Since the title feature is returning HTML code, perhaps I need to look at the actual content within that HTML. Let me check if there's a way to get the text content of the title, or if I should look at the description more carefully. The description mentions "Explores vitality and variety of life, arts, and public affairs of upper Midwest" which sounds like it could be the title or part of it. Let me try to get more information about this item by checking its neighbors or other features.

Since the title feature is returning HTML code, I should try to extract the actual title from within that HTML. The HTML code `<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"` appears to be incomplete - it might be missing the actual text content. Let me try to see if there's a way to get the complete title information, perhaps by checking if there are other item features or by looking at the raw data differently.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Minnesota Monthly Magazine Subscription]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_718.

Let me try searching for items related to Minnesota Monthly to see if I can find the correct title.
