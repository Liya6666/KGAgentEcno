Question: What is the average number of also-bought items for magazines in category Children &amp; Teen?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the average number of also-bought items for magazines in category Children &amp; Teen? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the average number of also_bought_item neighbors for magazine items in the "Children & Teen" category. First, I need to find all item nodes that are magazines and belong to the "Children & Teen" category. Then, for each such item, I need to get the number of also_bought_item neighbors, calculate the average, and return it.
Action 1: Thought 1: I need to find all magazine items in the "Children & Teen" category. However, I don't have a direct way to retrieve nodes by category. I should first find some magazine items and then check their categories to identify those in "Children & Teen".
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: Since I need to find magazine items in a specific category, I should first retrieve some magazine items. I can start by searching for magazine-related items using keywords like "magazine" or by finding items that might be categorized as magazines. Then, I can check their categories to filter for "Children & Teen".
Action 2: Thought 2: I need to find magazine items in the "Children & Teen" category. Let me start by searching for magazine-related items using the keyword "magazine" to retrieve relevant nodes.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to find magazine items in the "Children & Teen" category. Let me start by searching for magazine-related items using the keyword "magazine" to retrieve relevant nodes.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[magazine]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0018L5RJY.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I retrieved a node with ID B0018L5RJY using the keyword "magazine". Now I need to check if this is an item node and verify its category to see if it belongs to "Children & Teen". I should also check if it's actually a magazine item.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B0018L5RJY, category]
Observation 4: The category feature of B0018L5RJY are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieved node B0018L5RJY is in categories related to professional journals, not "Children & Teen". I need to find magazine items specifically in the "Children & Teen" category. Let me try searching with more specific keywords like "children magazine" or "teen magazine" to find relevant items.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[children magazine]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_775.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I retrieved a brand node (brand_775) instead of an item node when searching for "children magazine". This is not helpful for finding magazine items. I need to find item nodes that are magazines in the "Children & Teen" category. Let me try a different approach - I should search for specific magazine titles that might be in this category, or try to find items with "Children" or "Teen" in their titles that might be magazines.
Action 6: Thought 6: Searching for specific magazine titles might not be efficient. Instead, I should try to find items that have "Children" or "Teen" in their category. Let me search for items with "Children" in the title or description to start, then check if they are magazines and in the correct category.
Observation 6: 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I need a better approach. Since I need to find magazine items in the "Children & Teen" category, I should search for items with "Children" or "Teen" in their features, then check if they are magazines. Let me search for "Children" to find relevant items.
