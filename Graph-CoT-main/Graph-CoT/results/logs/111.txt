Question: How many items have identical frequently-purchased-together entries as item Pool Mate 1-2160 Algae Kill Swimming Pool Algaecide, 1-Quart?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items have identical frequently-purchased-together entries as item Pool Mate 1-2160 Algae Kill Swimming Pool Algaecide, 1-Quart? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items that have identical frequently-purchased-together entries as a specific item (Pool Mate 1-2160 Algae Kill Swimming Pool Algaecide, 1-Quart). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Pool Mate 1-2160 Algae Kill Swimming Pool Algaecide, 1-Quart]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_785.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned a brand node (brand_785) instead of an item node. This suggests that the item name might not match exactly, or there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the item node again with a more precise or alternative query.
Action 2: Thought 2: The retrieval returned a brand node instead of an item node, which is incorrect. I need to find the item node for "Pool Mate 1-2160 Algae Kill Swimming Pool Algaecide, 1-Quart". Perhaps the title isn't exact, or I should try a partial match or different approach. Let me try retrieving with a shorter or more specific keyword.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: Since the initial retrieval returned a brand node instead of an item node, I need to adjust my approach. The item title might be long or have variations. Let me try retrieving with a more focused keyword from the title, such as "Pool Mate Algae Kill" or check if there's a partial match available. Alternatively, I might need to search for items that contain parts of this title.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Pool Mate Algae Kill]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_176.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve "Pool Mate 1-2160 Algae Kill Swimming Pool Algaecide, 1-Quart". This suggests that the exact item title might not be in the graph, or I need to approach this differently. Let me try retrieving with a different part of the title or consider that the item might be stored under a slightly different name.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Algae Kill Swimming Pool Algaecide]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_176.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve this specific product. This suggests that either the exact item title doesn't exist in the graph, or I need to approach this differently. Let me try to find the item by searching for a more unique part of the title or consider that "Pool Mate" might be the brand name rather than part of the product title.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[1-2160 Algae Kill]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_106.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes, which suggests that "Pool Mate" might be a brand name rather than part of the product title. Let me try to retrieve the item by focusing on the product description part without the brand name, or try to find the brand first and then look for its items.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Pool Mate]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_176.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I see that "Pool Mate" is indeed a brand (brand_176). Now, to find the specific item "Pool Mate 1-2160 Algae Kill Swimming Pool Algaecide, 1-Quart", I should look for items under this brand that match the description. Let me get all items linked to brand_176.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[brand_176, item]
Observation 7: The item neighbors of brand_176 are: ['B00006K5RP']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: Now I have an item node ID 'B00006K5RP' for brand_176 (Pool Mate). Let me check if this is the correct item by looking at its title feature to confirm it matches "Pool Mate 1-2160 Algae Kill Swimming Pool Algaecide, 1-Quart".
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00006K5RP, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B00006K5RP are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than the actual title text. This suggests there might be an issue with how the feature is stored or retrieved. Let me try to get the description or other features to confirm if this is the correct item.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00006K5RP, description]
Observation 9: The description feature of B00006K5RP are: ['Focuses on the billiard industry and the professional tour.', '', '']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The description "Focuses on the billiard industry and the professional tour" doesn't match the expected algae killer product. This suggests that 'B00006K5RP' is not the correct item for "Pool Mate 1-2160 Algae Kill Swimming Pool Algaecide, 1-Quart". Let me try a different approach to find the correct item. Perhaps I should search for items with "Algae Kill" in their title or description.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Algae Kill 1-Quart]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_106.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve items. This suggests that the retrieval function might not be working as expected for item titles. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I need to search for items that contain specific keywords in their features. Since I can't directly search by feature content, I might need to find the correct item through its brand first. Let me try to find the brand for "Pool Mate" and then examine all its items to find the correct one.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[brand_176, item]
Observation 11: The item neighbors of brand_176 are: ['B00006K5RP']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I only found one item for brand_176 (Pool Mate), but it doesn't match the algae killer product. This suggests that either the brand has more items that aren't being returned, or "Pool Mate" might not be the correct brand for this specific product. Let me try to find the brand for this specific product by searching differently. Perhaps I should try to retrieve the item using the full product code "1-2160".
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[1-2160]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_216.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve items. This suggests that the RetrieveNode function might be prioritizing brand matches over item matches, or the exact item title isn't in the graph. Let me try a different approach - I'll search for items that might contain "Algaecide" in their title or description by trying to retrieve with that keyword.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Algaecide]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_361.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve items, which suggests that the RetrieveNode function might be prioritizing brand matches or the exact item titles aren't in the graph. Let me try a different approach - I'll search for items that might be related to pool maintenance or algae treatment by looking at their category or description features, but since I can't directly search by feature content, I need to find a way to identify the correct item.
Action 14: Thought 14: Since direct retrieval isn't working, I need to find the correct item by first identifying its brand. The product is "Pool Mate 1-2160 Algae Kill Swimming Pool Algaecide, 1-Quart". "Pool Mate" is likely the brand name. Let me try to find the brand node for "Pool Mate" and then check all its items to find the correct one.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I need to find the correct item by first identifying the brand "Pool Mate". From previous observations, I know that "Pool Mate" corresponds to brand_176. However, when I checked its items, I only found one item (B00006K5RP) that doesn't match the algae killer product. This suggests that either the brand has more items that aren't being returned, or there might be another brand with a similar name. Let me try to find all brands that contain "Pool Mate" in their name to ensure I have the correct brand.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Pool Mate brand]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_799.
Correct answer: 1
