Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with a specific item. The item is given with an HTML-like tag in its name: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the node ID for the target item. The question asks for items that share over 4 co-viewed items with this item. "Co-viewed items" likely refers to items that are both viewed together, meaning they are connected through also_viewed_item relationships. I need to find items that have a significant overlap in their also_viewed_item neighbors with node B00005N7NQ.
Action 2: Thought 2: To find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with node B00005N7NQ, I first need to identify the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ. Then, for each of these neighbors, I can check which other items also view them, and count the overlaps. However, a more efficient approach might be to check the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ and then see which other items have many of these same neighbors.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with node B00005N7NQ. First, I should retrieve all the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ to know what its co-viewed items are.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now I have the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for node B00005N7NQ. To find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with it, I need to check for each of these neighbor nodes, which other items also have them as also_viewed_item neighbors. Then I can count how many of these neighbors each item shares with B00005N7NQ.
Action 4: Action 4: For each also_viewed_item neighbor of B00005N7NQ, I need to find which items link to them. However, this approach might be inefficient since there are many neighbors. Instead, I should consider checking the also_viewed_item neighbors of each neighbor to find overlapping items. But this could be computationally heavy. Let me think of a better way.
Observation 4: 
Thought 5: Thought 5: A more efficient approach would be to first get all items that are connected to the same also_viewed_item neighbors. Since the graph structure shows that items are linked to also_viewed_item nodes, I can find items that share multiple common also_viewed_item neighbors with B00005N7NQ. I should retrieve all items that are linked to the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ, then count how many of these neighbors each item shares with B00005N7NQ.
Action 5: Action 5: For each also_viewed_item neighbor in the list from Observation 3, I need to find all items that link to them. Then I can count for each item how many of these neighbors it shares with B00005N7NQ.
Observation 5: 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I need to implement this approach systematically. Let me start by taking one of the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ and find all items that link to it. Then I'll repeat this for all neighbors and count overlaps.
Action 6: Action 6: Let me start with the first also_viewed_item neighbor: B000UHI2LW. I'll find all items that have this as an also_viewed_item neighbor.
Observation 6: 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I need to use the NeighbourCheck function to find which items have B000UHI2LW as an also_viewed_item neighbor. However, since B000UHI2LW is an item node itself, I should check what nodes link to it with the also_viewed_item relationship.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[B000UHI2LW, also_viewed_item]
Observation 7: The node or neighbor type does not exist in the graph. This might because your given neighbor type is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I see the issue. The also_viewed_item relationship connects from an item node to other item nodes. So when I check neighbors of B000UHI2LW (which is an item node), I should look for items that have B000UHI2LW as an also_viewed_item neighbor. But the relationship direction matters - I need to find items that link TO B000UHI2LW via also_viewed_item. However, in our graph definition, also_viewed_item links go from an item to other items that are viewed together. To find items that share co-viewed items, I need to find items that have overlapping sets of also_viewed_item neighbors.
Action 8: Thought 8: I need to reconsider the graph structure. The also_viewed_item relationship connects item nodes to other item nodes. To find items that share co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ, I need to find other items that have many of the same also_viewed_item neighbors as B00005N7NQ. I should first get all items in the graph, then for each item, check how many of its also_viewed_item neighbors overlap with those of B00005N7NQ. However, I don't have a function to get all items. Instead, I can work with the neighbors I have.
Observation 8: 
Thought 9: Thought 9: Since I cannot directly get all items in the graph, I need to work with the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ. For each of these neighbor items, I can find which other items link to them via the also_viewed_item relationship. This will give me items that share at least one co-viewed item with B00005N7NQ. Then I can count the overlaps.
Action 9: Action 9: Let me try a different approach. For each also_viewed_item neighbor of B00005N7NQ, I need to find items that have that neighbor as an also_viewed_item. I'll start with the first neighbor: B000UHI2LW. I'll check what items have B000UHI2LW as an also_viewed_item neighbor.
Observation 9: 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I need to clarify the direction of the relationship. When we say "item A has also_viewed_item B", it means there's a directed edge from A to B. To find items that share co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ, I need to find items that point to the same also_viewed_item nodes. So for each also_viewed_item neighbor of B00005N7NQ, I need to find all items that have that neighbor as an also_viewed_item.
Action 10: Action 10: NeighbourCheck[B000UHI2LW, also_viewed_item]
Observation 10: The node or neighbor type does not exist in the graph. This might because your given neighbor type is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm still having trouble with the direction of the relationship. Let me reconsider the graph structure. The also_viewed_item relationship connects from an item node to other item nodes. When I want to find items that link TO a particular item via also_viewed_item, I need to think about the reverse relationship. Perhaps I should check if there's a way to find incoming links, or I need to approach this differently.
Action 11: Thought 11: I need to reconsider the graph structure. The also_viewed_item relationship connects item nodes to other item nodes. When we say "item A has also_viewed_item B", it means there's a directed edge from A to B. To find items that share co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ, I need to find items that have overlapping sets of outgoing also_viewed_item connections.
Observation 11: 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I realize I've been approaching this incorrectly. The also_viewed_item relationship is directional - it goes FROM an item TO other items that are viewed together. To find items that share co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ, I need to find other items that have many of the same also_viewed_item neighbors in their outgoing connections.
Action 12: Thought 12: I need to find items that have overlapping also_viewed_item neighbors with B00005N7NQ. Since I have the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for B00005N7NQ, I should now find other items that have these same neighbors in their also_viewed_item connections. I'll start by getting the also_viewed_item neighbors of one of these neighbor items to see if they include B00005N7NQ and other items.
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I need to clarify my approach. The question asks for items that share over 4 co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ. This means I need to find items that have at least 5 common also_viewed_item neighbors with B00005N7NQ. Since I have the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for B00005N7NQ (from Observation 3), I should now find other items that have these same neighbors. However, I don't have a direct way to find all items in the graph. Instead, I can work with the neighbors I have - I can check each of the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ to see what items link to them (i.e., have them as also_viewed_item neighbors).
Action 13: Thought 13: I need to find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ. Since the also_viewed_item relationship is directional (from an item to other items), I need to find items that have overlapping outgoing also_viewed_item connections. A better approach would be to check each of the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ to see what other items also link to them. This will give me candidate items that share at least one co-viewed item with B00005N7NQ. Then I can count how many co-viewed items each candidate shares.
Observation 13: 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I need to find a way to identify items that link to the same also_viewed_item nodes as B00005N7NQ. Since the also_viewed_item relationship goes from an item to other items, I should check for each also_viewed_item neighbor of B00005N7NQ, what other items have that neighbor as an also_viewed_item. However, I need to be careful about the direction - I need to find items that point TO these neighbor items via the also_viewed_item relationship.

Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I need to reconsider the graph structure. The also_viewed_item relationship connects item nodes to other item nodes. When we say "item A has also_viewed_item B", it means there's a directed edge from A to B.

I should check for each also_viewed_item neighbor of B00005N7NQ, what other items have that neighbor as an also_viewed_item. However, I need to find the incoming links to these neighbor items. Let me try checking the neighbors of one of these items with a different relationship type to understand the graph structure better.
