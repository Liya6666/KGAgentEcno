Question: What is the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with Moshi Monsters Moshling Series 6 Complete set of 16?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with Moshi Monsters Moshling Series 6 Complete set of 16? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with "Moshi Monsters Moshling Series 6 Complete set of 16". First, I need to find the node for this item in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Moshi Monsters Moshling Series 6 Complete set of 16]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00K05O272.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the items that are often viewed together with this item. According to the graph definition, items are linked to "also_viewed_item" nodes. I should retrieve all the also_viewed_item neighbors for this node.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00K05O272, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00K05O272 are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that there are no also_viewed_item neighbors for this node. However, the question asks about items that are "often viewed together" with this item. According to the graph definition, items can also be linked to "buy_after_viewing_item" nodes, which might represent items that are viewed together. Let me check if there are any buy_after_viewing_item neighbors.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00K05O272, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 3: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00K05O272 are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Since both "also_viewed_item" and "buy_after_viewing_item" return empty lists, I should check if there are other relationship types that might indicate items viewed together. According to the graph definition, items can also be linked to "also_bought_item" and "bought_together_item" nodes. While these aren't exactly "viewed together," they might be the closest available relationships in the graph for items that are frequently associated. Let me check these relationships.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B00K05O272, also_bought_item]
Observation 4: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00K05O272 are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: All the relationship checks for this item are returning empty lists. This suggests that either the item has no associated items in the graph, or there might be an issue with the node ID. Let me verify the node features to ensure I have the correct item node, and also check if there are any other relationship types I might have missed.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00K05O272, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00K05O272 are: Lego Club Magazine May-june 2014. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: There's a discrepancy here. The retrieved node has the title "Lego Club Magazine May-june 2014" but I was looking for "Moshi Monsters Moshling Series 6 Complete set of 16". This suggests that the initial retrieval might have been incorrect. I need to try retrieving the node again with a more specific or different query.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Moshi Monsters Moshling Series 6 Complete set of 16]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00K05O272.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieval is consistently returning the same node ID (B00K05O272) but with a different title. This suggests that either the graph doesn't contain the exact item mentioned, or there might be an issue with how the item is stored. Let me try to search for "Moshi Monsters" more broadly to see if there are related items that might match.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Moshi Monsters Moshling Series 6]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B001BKE2MU.
Thought 8: Thought 8: Now I have a new node ID (B001BKE2MU) that might be more relevant to the Moshi Monsters item. Let me check its title to confirm if this is the correct item.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B001BKE2MU, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B001BKE2MU are: Shonen Jump. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: This is still not the correct item. Let me try a different approach and search for "Moshi Monsters" without the full description to see what items exist in the graph.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Moshi Monsters]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007GAMH.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm still not getting the correct item. Let me check the title of this node to see if it's related to Moshi Monsters.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00007GAMH, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B00007GAMH are: Moto Kids. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm having difficulty retrieving the correct node for "Moshi Monsters Moshling Series 6 Complete set of 16". Let me try a different strategy and search for "Moshling Series 6" which might be more specific to the item.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Moshling Series 6]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is B004D4UKPY.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm still not getting the correct item. Let me check the title of this node to see if it's related to Moshi Monsters.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B004D4UKPY, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B004D4UKPY are: TV Guide: Special Issue Star Wars The Phantom Menace Collector's Set. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm having difficulty retrieving the correct node for "Moshi Monsters Moshling Series 6 Complete set of 16". Let me try a different approach and search for "Moshling" which might be the most distinctive part of the item name.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Moshling]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_284.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I retrieved a brand node (brand_284) instead of an item node. Let me check the name of this brand to see if it's related to Moshi Monsters.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[brand_284, name]
Observation 14: The name feature of brand_284 are: Heavy Metal. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm still not getting the correct item node for "Moshi Monsters Moshling Series 6 Complete set of 16". Since the retrieval isn't working with the exact title, let me try to find items that might be related by checking the category or other features. However, since I need to find the typical cost of items viewed together with this specific item, and I can't find the item itself, I might need to assume that the item exists in the graph with a slightly different title or approach this differently. Let me try to search for "Moshi Monsters" in a way that might return multiple items or check if there are any items with "Moshling" in their title.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Moshi Monsters Moshling Series 6 Complete set of 16] (with exact match)
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00K05O272.
Correct answer: 17.42
