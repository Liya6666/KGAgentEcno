Question: Which items from publisher Heavy Metal have the most also-viewed items?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which items from publisher Heavy Metal have the most also-viewed items? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items from the publisher "Heavy Metal" that have the most also-viewed items. First, I need to find the brand node for "Heavy Metal" since "publisher" likely refers to a brand in this context.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Heavy Metal]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_284.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the brand node ID for Heavy Metal. I need to find all items that are linked to this brand node. I can use NeighbourCheck to get all item nodes associated with brand_284.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_284, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_284 are: ['B00006KGRH']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I found one item node (B00006KGRH) associated with the Heavy Metal brand. Now I need to check how many also_viewed_item neighbors this item has to determine which items have the most also-viewed items. Since there's only one item, it will automatically have the most also-viewed items, but I should verify the count and get the item's title.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeDegree[B00006KGRH, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00006KGRH are: 1. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have found that the item B00006KGRH from Heavy Metal has 1 also_viewed_item neighbor. Since there's only one item from this brand, it automatically has the most also-viewed items. Now I need to get the title/name of this item to answer the question properly.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00006KGRH, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00006KGRH are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature seems to contain HTML markup. I need to extract the actual title text. Let me try getting the description or check if there's a cleaner title representation.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00006KGRH, description]
Observation 5: The description feature of B00006KGRH are: ['Heavy Metal is an adult science fiction and fantasy magazine, both contemporary and futuristic in theme. Experience the beautiful artwork featured in each issue.']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The description doesn't give me the actual item title. Let me try to get the category feature or see if there's another way to get the item's name. Alternatively, I should check if the title feature has more information or if I need to parse it differently.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00006KGRH, category]
Observation 6: The category feature of B00006KGRH are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Entertainment & Pop Culture']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The category information doesn't give me the item's title. Let me try to retrieve the node using a different approach or check if there's a way to get a cleaner title. Perhaps I should try retrieving the node by its ID to see if I can get better title information.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[B00006KGRH]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006K6FV.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I see that retrieving by the ID B00006KGRH returned a different node ID (B00006K6FV). This suggests there might be an issue with the node ID. Let me try to get the title feature again using the correct node ID B00006K6FV.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00006K6FV, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B00006K6FV are: Brio. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title "Brio" doesn't seem to match Heavy Metal magazine. There might be an issue with the node retrieval. Let me try to find the Heavy Metal brand items again using a different approach. Perhaps I should search for items with "Heavy Metal" in their title or description to ensure I have the correct items.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Heavy Metal magazine]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_546.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I got a different brand node (brand_546) when searching for "Heavy Metal magazine". Let me check the name of this brand to confirm if it's the correct publisher.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[brand_546, name]
Observation 10: The name feature of brand_546 are: MusicMaker Magazine. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: That's not the correct brand either. Let me try a different approach. I should search for items that have "Heavy Metal" in their title or description to find the correct items from this publisher.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Heavy Metal]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_284.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm getting inconsistent results when trying to find Heavy Metal items. Let me try a different strategy. Since I need to find items from the publisher "Heavy Metal," I should first verify the brand node's name to ensure I have the correct publisher.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[brand_284, name]
Observation 12: The name feature of brand_284 are: Heavy Metal. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: Good, I've confirmed that brand_284 is indeed the "Heavy Metal" publisher. Now I need to get all items associated with this brand. Let me use NeighbourCheck again to get the complete list of item nodes.
Action 13: Action 13: NeighbourCheck[brand_284, item]
Observation 13: The item neighbors of brand_284 are: ['B00006KGRH']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I have confirmed that brand_284 is the Heavy Metal publisher, and it has one associated item node: B00006KGRH. However, when I tried to get the title of this item earlier, I encountered issues. Let me try to get the title feature again, but this time I'll be more careful about the node ID. Since Observation 7 showed that retrieving B00006KGRH returned node ID B00006K6FV, let me work with B00006K6FV and verify if it's actually related to Heavy Metal.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00006K6FV, title]
Observation 14: The title feature of B00006K6FV are: Brio. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The title "Brio" doesn't seem related to Heavy Metal. There might be an issue with the node relationships. Let me check what brand is associated with the item node B00006K6FV to verify if it's actually from Heavy Metal publisher.
Action 15: Action 15: NeighbourCheck[B00006K6FV, brand]
Observation 15: The brand neighbors of B00006K6FV are: [].
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
