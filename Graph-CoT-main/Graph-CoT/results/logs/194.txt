Question: What is the complement to this request: flyfishing leadfree splitshot?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the complement to this request: flyfishing leadfree splitshot? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the "complement" to the request "flyfishing leadfree splitshot". This seems to be asking for items that are related to this query, likely through the "bought_together" relationship. First, I need to find the node corresponding to "flyfishing leadfree splitshot".
Action 1: RetrieveNode[flyfishing leadfree splitshot]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_826.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation shows that "flyfishing leadfree splitshot" corresponds to a brand node (brand_826), not an item node. The question asks for a "complement" to this request, which typically refers to items that are bought together. Since brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, I should first find the items associated with this brand.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_826, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_826 are: ['B005EI4YNM']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: Now I have the item ID associated with this brand. To find the complement (likely items bought together), I need to check the "bought_together_item" neighbors of this item node.
Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B005EI4YNM, bought_together_item]
Observation 3: The bought_together_item neighbors of B005EI4YNM are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The bought_together_item neighbors list is empty. Perhaps I should try other relationship types that might indicate complementary items, such as "also_bought_item" or "buy_after_viewing_item". Let me check "also_bought_item" neighbors.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B005EI4YNM, also_bought_item]
Observation 4: The also_bought_item neighbors of B005EI4YNM are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: Both "bought_together_item" and "also_bought_item" neighbors are empty. Let me try checking "also_viewed_item" neighbors, as these might also be considered complementary items that customers view together.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B005EI4YNM, also_viewed_item]
Observation 5: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B005EI4YNM are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: All the relationship checks for the item node B005EI4YNM returned empty lists. Perhaps I need to first understand what "flyfishing leadfree splitshot" actually represents. Since it was retrieved as a brand node, let me check the brand's features to better understand what we're dealing with.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[brand_826, name]
Observation 6: The name feature of brand_826 are: Northwest Fly Fishing. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: Now I understand that "flyfishing leadfree splitshot" corresponds to the brand "Northwest Fly Fishing". Since the item associated with this brand has no related items through the typical relationship types, perhaps the question is asking for complementary products to fly fishing gear in general. Let me check if there are other items from this brand that might have complementary relationships, or perhaps I should look at the category of the item to find related products.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B005EI4YNM, category]
Observation 7: The category feature of B005EI4YNM are: []. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The category feature is empty. Let me check the title and description of the item to better understand what product we're dealing with, which might help identify potential complements.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B005EI4YNM, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B005EI4YNM are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title feature appears to be HTML code rather than a readable product title. Let me check the description feature to get more information about this item.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B005EI4YNM, description]
Observation 9: The description feature of B005EI4YNM are: ['Issued quarterly, Eastern Fly Fishing magazine is a destination specific publication to viewed as an inspiring, collectible reference of Eastern angling destinations. Each issue of Eastern Fly Fishing features six angling destinations, including both the famous and the lesser-known waters.']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The description reveals that this item is actually "Eastern Fly Fishing magazine" - a publication about fly fishing destinations. This is quite different from what I expected based on the query "flyfishing leadfree splitshot" (which sounds like fishing tackle/weights). The brand name "Northwest Fly Fishing" also seems mismatched with the magazine content about Eastern destinations.
Action 10: Thought 10: There seems to be a mismatch between the query "flyfishing leadfree splitshot" and the actual item found. The query sounds like it should refer to fishing tackle (lead-free split shot weights for fly fishing), but the retrieved brand and item are about a fly fishing magazine. Let me try to search for the query as an item title instead, as it might be a product name.
Observation 10: 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The previous approach retrieved "flyfishing leadfree splitshot" as a brand node, but the description suggests it might actually be an item. Let me try to retrieve it as an item node instead, as the query might be a product title.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[flyfishing leadfree splitshot]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_826.
Thought 12: Thought 12: The retrieval still returns brand_826. Perhaps the query "flyfishing leadfree splitshot" is not an exact match for any item title. Let me try to search for items related to fly fishing or split shot weights by checking the item nodes connected to this brand, or search for items with similar keywords. Since we already have one item (B005EI4YNM) which is a magazine, let me check if there are other items from this brand that might be the actual "flyfishing leadfree splitshot" product.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[brand_826, item]
Observation 12: The item neighbors of brand_826 are: ['B005EI4YNM']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: Since there's only one item associated with this brand, and it's a magazine rather than fishing tackle, I need to reconsider the approach. The question asks for the "complement" to the request "flyfishing leadfree splitshot". Perhaps I should interpret this as finding items that are typically complementary to fly fishing gear in general, rather than specifically to this query. Let me check if there are other brands or items related to fly fishing that might have complementary relationships.
Action 13: Thought 13: Since the current approach isn't yielding results, I should reconsider the interpretation of "complement." In e-commerce contexts, "complement" often refers to items that are frequently bought together. The query "flyfishing leadfree splitshot" likely refers to a specific fishing product (lead-free split shot weights for fly fishing). Since it's not matching directly as an item, I should search for items with similar keywords in their titles or descriptions that might be the actual product, then find their complementary items.
Observation 13: 
Thought 14: Thought 14: Since the direct retrieval of "flyfishing leadfree splitshot" only returns a brand node, and the associated item appears to be unrelated (a magazine), I need to search for items that might match this query as a product. Let me try to search for items with keywords from the query, such as "split shot" or "lead free" in their titles.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[split shot]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006K6E1.
Thought 15: Thought 15: Great! I found an item node (B00006K6E1) by searching for "split shot". Now I need to check if this is indeed related to fly fishing and lead-free weights, and then find its complementary items.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00006K6E1, title]
Observation 15: The title feature of B00006K6E1 are: Breakaway.
Correct answer: Dinsmores Split Shot Multi-Shot Dispensers 4 Shot (Sizes No.4-No.10)
