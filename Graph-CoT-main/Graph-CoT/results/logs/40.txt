Question: How many items are usually bought together with Nokia 6020,5140,3220 890mAh Lithium Battery?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items are usually bought together with Nokia 6020,5140,3220 890mAh Lithium Battery? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of items usually bought together with a specific item (Nokia 6020,5140,3220 890mAh Lithium Battery). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Nokia 6020,5140,3220 890mAh Lithium Battery]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_528" as the node ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should verify if this is indeed the correct node by checking its features to confirm it's an item node.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_528, name]
Observation 2: The name feature of brand_528 are: Tablet Publ Co. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The node retrieved as "brand_528" has the name "Tablet Publ Co.", which is clearly a brand name, not the item "Nokia 6020,5140,3220 890mAh Lithium Battery". This indicates that the initial retrieval might have been incorrect. I need to try retrieving the item node again, perhaps with a more specific or alternative query.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Nokia 6020,5140,3220 890mAh Lithium Battery item]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval is still returning a brand node instead of the item node. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with this exact title. I should try to retrieve the node using a partial keyword or consider that the item might be listed under a different name. Let me try with "Nokia 6020" or "890mAh Lithium Battery" to see if I can find the correct item node.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Nokia 6020]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval is consistently returning brand_528 for various Nokia-related queries, which is problematic. This suggests that either the item doesn't exist in the graph or there's an issue with the retrieval function. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for "Lithium Battery" or "890mAh" to see if I can find battery-related items.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[890mAh Lithium Battery]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BYTOWA.
Thought 6: Thought 6: Great! Now I have a node ID "B000BYTOWA" that seems to be an item node (not a brand). Let me verify this by checking its features to confirm it's the correct item.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B000BYTOWA, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B000BYTOWA are: Backpacking Light. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The title "Backpacking Light" doesn't match the Nokia battery item I'm looking for. This suggests that "890mAh Lithium Battery" might not be specific enough. Let me try a more precise search for the exact item name or try to find Nokia battery items.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Nokia 6020 890mAh Lithium Battery]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm still getting brand_528 when searching for Nokia-related terms. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for "Nokia battery" or checking if there are any items linked to brand_528 that might be the battery I'm looking for.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[brand_528, item]
Observation 8: The item neighbors of brand_528 are: ['B00007LOKX']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: Now I have an item node ID 'B00007LOKX' that belongs to brand_528. Let me check its title to see if it matches the Nokia battery item I'm looking for.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00007LOKX, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B00007LOKX are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The title feature seems to be returning HTML code instead of a proper title. This might be a data issue. Let me try checking other features like description to identify what this item is.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00007LOKX, description]
Observation 10: The description feature of B00007LOKX are: ['A source of progressive, responsible Catholic thinking. Contains articles and international Church news, special reports and analysis of official church documents, editorial comment, book reviews, art and more. Rich in history and published weekly in the UK.']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: This item appears to be a Catholic publication, not a Nokia battery. This confirms that brand_528 is not the correct brand for Nokia products. I need to find the correct brand node for Nokia first, then find the battery item. Let me try to retrieve the Nokia brand directly.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Nokia brand]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_728.
Thought 12: Thought 12: Great! Now I have a brand node "brand_728" that likely corresponds to Nokia. Let me verify this by checking its name feature.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[brand_728, name]
Observation 12: The name feature of brand_728 are: Trusted Media Brands, Inc.. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The brand node "brand_728" has the name "Trusted Media Brands, Inc.", which doesn't seem to be Nokia. This suggests that Nokia might not be a brand in this graph, or it might be listed under a different name. Let me try a different approach and search for the exact item title again, but perhaps with more specific keywords or try to find battery items in general.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Nokia 3220 890mAh Lithium Battery]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently getting brand_528 for Nokia-related queries, which appears to be incorrect. Let me try a completely different approach - searching for "Lithium Battery" to see if I can find battery items, then look for Nokia-specific ones among them.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Lithium Battery]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BYTOWA.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm getting the same "B000BYTOWA" node again, which has the title "Backpacking Light" - clearly not a battery. This suggests that the retrieval function might not be working as expected for this specific item. Let me try a different strategy: perhaps the item exists but with a slightly different title. Let me try searching for "Nokia battery" without specific model numbers.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Nokia battery]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Correct answer: 0
