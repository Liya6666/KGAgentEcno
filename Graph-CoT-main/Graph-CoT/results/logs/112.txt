Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with a specific item. The item's title appears to be incomplete or malformed: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?". I need to first retrieve this item node using the given title fragment.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the node ID for the target item. The question asks for items that share over 4 co-viewed items with this item. "Co-viewed items" likely refers to "also_viewed_item" neighbors. I need to find items that have more than 4 overlapping also_viewed_item neighbors with node B00005N7NQ. First, I should get the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I now have the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for the target item. To find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ, I need to check other items and see how many of their also_viewed_item neighbors overlap with this list. First, I should get all items that are connected to B00005N7NQ through some relationship, as they might be candidates. Let me check what other items are connected to B00005N7NQ via relationships like also_bought_item, bought_together_item, etc.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have the also_bought_item neighbors, but I need to focus on co-viewed items (also_viewed_item). To find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ, I should check the also_viewed_item neighbors of other items and compare them with the list from Observation 2. A good starting point is to check items that are directly connected to B00005N7NQ (e.g., also_bought_item neighbors) since they might share viewed items. Let me pick one candidate from the also_bought_item list, say B01AKS14AQ (which also appears in the also_viewed_item list), and check its also_viewed_item neighbors.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B01AKS14AQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 4: The node or neighbor type does not exist in the graph. This might because your given neighbor type is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The neighbor type "also_viewed_item" might not exist for node B01AKS14AQ, or the node might not have that relationship. Let me try to retrieve the node first to confirm it exists and check its available features or relationships.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[B01AKS14AQ]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I see the issue - B01AKS14AQ is actually a brand node (brand_411), not an item node. I need to focus on item nodes only. Let me go back to the also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ and filter for item nodes. I should check if these neighbors are items or brands by trying to retrieve them.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[B01MCU84LB]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm finding that many of the IDs from the also_bought_item list are actually brand nodes, not item nodes. I need to be more careful about distinguishing between item and brand nodes. Let me try a different approach. Since the question asks about items that share co-viewed items, I should focus on the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ that are themselves item nodes, and then check their also_viewed_item neighbors to find overlaps.
Action 7: Thought 7: I need to focus on item nodes that might share co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ. Let me first verify that the also_viewed_item neighbors from Observation 2 are indeed item nodes by retrieving one of them.
Observation 7: 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I need to verify that the also_viewed_item neighbors from Observation 2 are item nodes. Let me retrieve one of them to confirm.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I see that B000UHI2LW is actually a brand node, not an item node. This suggests that the also_viewed_item relationships might be connecting to brand nodes rather than item nodes, which contradicts the graph definition. Let me check the graph definition again - it says "Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes." This implies that also_viewed_item should connect to other item nodes, not brand nodes. There might be an inconsistency in the graph data. Let me try retrieving another also_viewed_item neighbor to verify.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[B002PXW18E]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm consistently finding that the also_viewed_item neighbors are being retrieved as brand nodes, which contradicts the graph definition. This suggests there might be an issue with how the graph is structured or how I'm interpreting the data. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I should focus on finding items that are connected to B00005N7NQ through other relationships and then check their also_viewed_item connections. Let me first get the brand of B00005N7NQ to understand its context better.
Action 10: Action 10: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 10: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: I have the brand node for B00005N7NQ. Now I should find other items that share the same brand, as they might share co-viewed items. Let me get all items connected to brand_0.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[brand_0, item]
Observation 11: The item neighbors of brand_0 are: ['B00005N7NQ']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I see that brand_0 only has one item (B00005N7NQ), so I can't find other items through the brand connection. Let me try a different approach. Since the also_viewed_item relationships seem to be connecting to brand nodes rather than item nodes (based on my earlier observations), perhaps I need to interpret "co-viewed items" differently. Maybe "co-viewed items" refers to items that are viewed together, meaning they share the same also_viewed_item brand connections. Let me check how many also_viewed_item neighbors B00005N7NQ has (which are brand nodes) and then find other items that share more than 4 of these brand connections.
Action 12: Thought 12: I need to reconsider the problem. The graph definition states that item nodes are linked to "also_viewed_item nodes," but my observations show these connections are to brand nodes. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the graph structure, or "also_viewed_item" might be connecting to items through brand relationships. Let me first check the number of also_viewed_item neighbors for B00005N7NQ to establish a baseline.
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I need to check the number of also_viewed_item neighbors for B00005N7NQ to understand the scale of connections.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 13: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 24. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I have confirmed that B00005N7NQ has 24 also_viewed_item neighbors. Now I need to find other items that share over 4 of these co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ. Since my previous attempts showed that the also_viewed_item connections lead to brand nodes, I should look for other items that have also_viewed_item relationships to the same brand nodes. Let me first get the complete list of brand nodes that are also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ from Observation 2, then find items that connect to these same brands through also_viewed_item relationships.
Action 14: Thought 14: I need to find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ. Since the also_viewed_item relationships appear to connect to brand nodes, I should find other items that have also_viewed_item relationships to the same brand nodes as B00005N7NQ. First, I need to get all items in the graph that have also_viewed_item relationships, then check how many of their also_viewed_item brand neighbors overlap with B00005N7NQ's also_viewed_item brands. However, I don't have a direct way to get all items in the graph. Let me try to find items through other relationships first.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I need to find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ. Since the also_viewed_item relationships connect to brand nodes, I should look for other items that have overlapping also_viewed_item brand connections. Let me try to find some candidate items by checking items that are connected to B00005N7NQ through other relationships like also_bought_item or bought_together_item, and then check their also_viewed_item brand connections.
Action 15: Thought 15: I need to find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ. Since the also_viewed_item relationships connect to brand nodes, I should look for other items that have overlapping also_viewed_item brand connections. Let me try to find some candidate items by checking items that are connected to B00005N7NQ through other relationships like also_bought_item or bought_together_item, and then check their also_viewed_item brand connections.
