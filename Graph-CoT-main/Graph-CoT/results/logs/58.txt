Question: How many also-bought items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many also-bought items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of also-bought items for a specific item. However, the item name appears to be incomplete or corrupted - it shows HTML/CSS classes instead of a proper item title. I need to first identify the correct item node. The HTML snippet "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"" might be part of a product title, but I need the full title to retrieve the correct node.
Action 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of also-bought items for a specific item. However, the item name appears to be incomplete or corrupted - it shows HTML/CSS classes instead of a proper item title. I need to first identify the correct item node. The HTML snippet "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"" might be part of a product title, but I need the full title to retrieve the correct node.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: Since the item name appears to be incomplete or corrupted in the question, I should try to retrieve the node using the provided text as a keyword. It's possible that this HTML snippet might be part of the actual item title in the graph database.
Action 2: Action 2: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 3: Thought 3: I've successfully retrieved a node with ID B00005N7NQ using the provided HTML snippet. Now I need to verify that this is indeed the correct item by checking its title feature to confirm it matches the intended item.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The node's title feature confirms that this is indeed the correct item node. Now I need to find out how many also_bought_item neighbors this item has. I should use the NodeDegree function to count the number of also_bought_item neighbors.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 4: The also_bought_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 38. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: I have found that the item has 38 also_bought_item neighbors. However, the question specifically asks to provide the answer using node main features (names) rather than node IDs. This means I need to retrieve the actual titles/names of these also-bought items, not just count them.
Action 5: Thought 5: I need to retrieve the actual titles of the 38 also_bought_item neighbors. I should use NeighbourCheck to get the list of neighbor nodes, then retrieve each node's title feature.
Observation 5: 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I need to get the list of also_bought_item neighbors and then retrieve their titles. I'll use NeighbourCheck to get the neighbor nodes, and then for each node, I'll retrieve its title feature.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 6: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I have the list of 38 also_bought_item neighbor node IDs. Now I need to retrieve the title feature for each of these nodes to provide the answer with item names rather than IDs. Since there are 38 nodes, I should retrieve their titles systematically.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B01MCU84LB, title]
Observation 7: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I encountered an error when trying to retrieve the title feature for node B01MCU84LB. This suggests that either the node ID is incorrect or the feature name might be different. Let me first verify if this node exists and what type of node it is. I should try retrieving the node using its ID to confirm it exists.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[B01MCU84LB]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I see that node B01MCU84LB is actually a brand node (brand_411), not an item node. This explains why it doesn't have a "title" feature - brand nodes only have "name" features. I need to retrieve the "name" feature instead of "title" for brand nodes. Let me get the name of this brand.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[brand_411, name]
Observation 9: The name feature of brand_411 are: 1105 Media. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I see that some of the also_bought_item neighbors are actually brand nodes rather than item nodes. I need to systematically check each neighbor node to determine if it's an item or brand, and then retrieve the appropriate feature (title for items, name for brands). Since there are 38 neighbors, I should create a comprehensive list of their names/titles.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B01AKS14AQ, title]
Observation 10: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm encountering the same issue with node B01AKS14AQ - it appears to be a brand node rather than an item node. I need to systematically check each neighbor to determine if it's an item or brand node, and then retrieve the appropriate feature. Let me first verify the node type for B01AKS14AQ by retrieving it.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[B01AKS14AQ]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I notice that both B01MCU84LB and B01AKS14AQ are resolving to the same brand node (brand_411). This suggests there might be an issue with the neighbor list or node IDs. Let me continue checking the next neighbor to understand the pattern better.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[B001THPA26]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_381.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm finding that many of the "also_bought_item" neighbors are actually brand nodes rather than item nodes. This suggests that the graph might have a different structure than I initially understood, or there might be an issue with how the neighbors are being returned. Let me check a few more neighbors to understand the pattern, and then I need to find a way to get the actual item names for the also-bought items.
Action 13: Thought 13: I'm finding that the "also_bought_item" neighbors being returned are brand nodes rather than item nodes, which contradicts the graph definition. This suggests there might be an issue with how the neighbors are being retrieved or with the graph structure itself. Let me try a different approach - I should first verify what type of node B00005N7NQ is, and then check if there's a different way to get the also-bought items.
Observation 13: 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I need to verify what type of node B00005N7NQ is, as this might help me understand why the also_bought_item neighbors are returning brand nodes instead of item nodes. Let me check the node's features to confirm its type.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 14: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The category feature confirms that B00005N7NQ is indeed an item node. The issue seems to be that the also_bought_item neighbors being returned are brand nodes rather than item nodes. This might be a data issue or a misunderstanding of the graph structure. Let me try to check if there are any actual item nodes connected as also_bought_item neighbors by examining a few more neighbors and their types.
Action 15: Thought 15: I need to systematically check the types of all the neighbor nodes to understand what's happening. Since there are 38 neighbors, I should check a few more to see if any are actually item nodes, or if they're all brand nodes. Let me check the next few neighbors.
Observation 15:
Correct answer: 0
