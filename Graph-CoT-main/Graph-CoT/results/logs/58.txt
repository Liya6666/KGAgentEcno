Question: What count of buy-after-viewing items does AVEDA by Aveda: MADDER ROOT COLOR CONDITIONER 8.5 OZ have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What count of buy-after-viewing items does AVEDA by Aveda: MADDER ROOT COLOR CONDITIONER 8.5 OZ have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the count of buy-after-viewing items for a specific item node (AVEDA by Aveda: MADDER ROOT COLOR CONDITIONER 8.5 OZ). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[AVEDA by Aveda: MADDER ROOT COLOR CONDITIONER 8.5 OZ]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0007XWHVK.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the count of buy-after-viewing items for this node. The question asks for the count, so I should use NodeDegree to get the number of buy_after_viewing_item neighbors.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B0007XWHVK, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 2: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbor node degree of B0007XWHVK are: 0. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the node has 0 buy_after_viewing_item neighbors. However, the question asks to provide the count by listing the main features (names) of these items, but since there are none, I should simply return 0.
Action 3: Finish[0]
Observation 3: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 0
