Question: What is the average number of also-bought items for magazines in category Girls?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.

Action 1: Thought 1: I need to find all magazine items in the "Girls" category. However, I don't have a direct way to query items by category. I should first find some magazine items and then check their categories to identify those in the "Girls" category.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: Since I need to find magazine items in the "Girls" category, I should start by retrieving a magazine item node to understand the structure. I can then check its category and see if it's "Girls". If not, I might need to find other magazine items.
