Question: Can you tell me the cost of Motorcycle CREE lights LED fog street touring cruiser dual sport off?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you tell me the cost of Motorcycle CREE lights LED fog street touring cruiser dual sport off? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item node with the title "Motorcycle CREE lights LED fog street touring cruiser dual sport off". I need to first retrieve this item node from the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Motorcycle CREE lights LED fog street touring cruiser dual sport off]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BYTOWA.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B000BYTOWA), I need to get the price feature of this item node as requested. The question specifically asks for the cost, which corresponds to the "price" feature.
Action 2: NodeFeature[B000BYTOWA, price]
Observation 2: The price feature of B000BYTOWA are: . 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the price feature for node B000BYTOWA is empty. This might indicate that the price information is missing or not available in the graph. However, I should double-check if I have the correct node by verifying its title feature to ensure I retrieved the right item.
Action 3: NodeFeature[B000BYTOWA, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B000BYTOWA are: Backpacking Light. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title feature shows "Backpacking Light", which doesn't match the requested item "Motorcycle CREE lights LED fog street touring cruiser dual sport off". This suggests that the initial retrieval may have been incorrect or there might be a mismatch. I should try to retrieve the node again with a more specific or alternative query, or check if there are other related nodes.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[Motorcycle CREE lights LED fog street touring cruiser dual sport off lights]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BYTOWA.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval is still returning the same node ID (B000BYTOWA) with the title "Backpacking Light", which doesn't match the requested item. This suggests that the exact title might not be in the graph, or there might be a different representation. I should try to search with a shorter or more specific keyword from the original title, such as "Motorcycle CREE lights" or check if there are other related nodes by exploring the graph further. Alternatively, I can look for nodes that might have similar features or are in the same category.
Action 5: RetrieveNode[Motorcycle CREE lights]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BYTOWA.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieval continues to return the same node ID (B000BYTOWA) regardless of the query variation, which suggests that this might be the closest match in the graph database. However, since the title doesn't match the requested item, I should consider if there are other related items that might be the correct one. Perhaps I can explore the category or description features of this node to see if it's related to motorcycle lights, or check for other nodes with similar features.
Action 6: NodeFeature[B000BYTOWA, category]
Observation 6: The category feature of B000BYTOWA are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The category feature is empty, which doesn't help. Let me check the description feature to see if it contains any information about motorcycle lights or if this might be the wrong item entirely.
Action 7: NodeFeature[B000BYTOWA, description]
Observation 7: The description feature of B000BYTOWA are: []. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The description is also empty. This suggests that node B000BYTOWA might not be the correct item for "Motorcycle CREE lights LED fog street touring cruiser dual sport off". I should try a different approach. Perhaps I can search for nodes with "CREE lights" or "LED fog" in their titles, or look for items in related categories. Alternatively, I can check if there are other nodes that might be linked to this one as also_viewed or also_bought items, which could include the correct item.
Action 8: RetrieveNode[CREE lights LED fog street touring cruiser dual sport off]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BYTOWA.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The retrieval consistently returns the same node ID (B000BYTOWA) regardless of the query variation, and its features don't match the requested item. This suggests that the exact item "Motorcycle CREE lights LED fog street touring cruiser dual sport off" might not exist in the graph database, or it might be represented differently. Since the question asks for the cost, and I cannot find the correct node, I should conclude that the price information is not available in the graph for this specific item.
Action 9: Finish[The price information for the item "Motorcycle CREE lights LED fog street touring cruiser dual sport off" is not available in the graph database, as the retrieved node (B000BYTOWA) with title "Backpacking Light" does not match the requested item and has no price data.]
Observation 9: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 32.85
