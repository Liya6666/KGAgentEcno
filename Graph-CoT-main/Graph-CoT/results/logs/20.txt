Question: How many co-viewed items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many co-viewed items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of co-viewed items for a specific item. The item's title appears to be incomplete or possibly malformed: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". This looks like HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the node using this string, but it might not match exactly. I should try to retrieve the node as given.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have the node ID B00005N7NQ. The question asks for the number of co-viewed items, which likely refers to "also_viewed_item" neighbors. I need to calculate the node degree for also_viewed_item neighbors.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 24. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The question asks for the number of co-viewed items, and I've found that there are 24 also_viewed_item neighbors. However, the question specifies to "answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs." This means I need to list the titles of these co-viewed items, not just the count. I should retrieve the neighbors and then get their titles.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have the list of 24 also_viewed_item neighbor node IDs. To answer the question properly, I need to get the main feature (title) for each of these item nodes, as requested. I should retrieve the title feature for each neighbor node ID.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 4: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I tried to get the title feature for one of the neighbor nodes, but it failed. The error suggests that the feature name might not be correct. According to the graph definition, item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. So "title" should be correct. Perhaps the node ID is invalid or there's an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to get the title of the original item first to verify the node exists and has the correct features.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I see the issue now. The original item's title is actually the HTML code "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"", which explains why the retrieval worked. However, when I tried to get the title feature for the neighbor node B000UHI2LW, it failed. This suggests that either the node IDs in the neighbor list might be incorrect, or there's an issue with how I'm querying. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I should check if these neighbor nodes exist by trying to retrieve their basic information first.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I see the problem now. When I retrieved the neighbor node ID "B000UHI2LW", it returned a brand node (brand_756) instead of an item node. This suggests that the neighbor list might include both item and brand nodes, or there might be an issue with the graph structure. According to the graph definition, item nodes should only be linked to other item nodes through "also_viewed_item" relationships. Let me check the neighbor types more carefully.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 7: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I see the same list of neighbors again. The issue might be that some of these IDs correspond to brand nodes rather than item nodes. Let me check what type of node "B000UHI2LW" is by trying to get its features. Since it was retrieved as "brand_756", let me try to get the name feature of that brand node.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[brand_756, name]
Observation 8: The name feature of brand_756 are: TWOBIU. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I see that "B000UHI2LW" corresponds to a brand node (brand_756) with name "TWOBIU". This suggests that the "also_viewed_item" relationship might be linking to both item and brand nodes, which contradicts the graph definition. Let me check another neighbor to confirm this pattern.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[B002PXW18E]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I see a pattern emerging. When I retrieve these neighbor IDs, they are being mapped to brand nodes rather than item nodes. This suggests that the "also_viewed_item" relationship might be incorrectly linking to brand nodes, or there might be an issue with how the graph is structured. According to the graph definition, "also_viewed_item" should link to other item nodes. Let me try to get the title feature of one of these neighbor IDs directly, treating them as item nodes.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B002PXW18E, title]
Observation 10: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm encountering a consistent issue where the neighbor IDs from the "also_viewed_item" relationship are being retrieved as brand nodes rather than item nodes. This contradicts the graph definition which states that item nodes should be linked to other item nodes through "also_viewed_item" relationships. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I should check what type of node the original item is and verify its relationships.
Action 11: Thought 11: I need to verify the node type of the original item B00005N7NQ and understand why its "also_viewed_item" neighbors are being retrieved as brand nodes. Let me check the features of the original node to confirm it's an item node.
Observation 11: 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I need to verify the node type of B00005N7NQ by checking its features. If it's an item node, it should have features like title, description, etc. Let me check one of its features to confirm.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 12: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I've confirmed that B00005N7NQ is indeed an item node since it has a category feature. However, there seems to be an inconsistency in the graph where the "also_viewed_item" relationships are pointing to brand nodes instead of item nodes. Since the question asks for co-viewed items and specifies to provide node main features (names) rather than IDs, I need to find a way to get the actual item titles. Let me try to check if these brand nodes have associated items that might be the actual co-viewed items.
Action 13: Thought 13: Since the "also_viewed_item" neighbors are being retrieved as brand nodes, perhaps I need to find the items associated with these brands to get the actual co-viewed items. According to the graph definition, brand nodes are linked to their item nodes. Let me check the items associated with one of these brand nodes to see if that gives me the co-viewed items.
Observation 13: 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I need to find the actual co-viewed items. Since the "also_viewed_item" neighbors are returning brand nodes, perhaps I should check what items are associated with these brands, as those might be the intended co-viewed items. Let me start with one brand node and check its associated items.
Action 14: Action 14: NeighbourCheck[brand_756, item]
Observation 14: The item neighbors of brand_756 are: ['B000VL7EW0']. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I found that brand_756 (which corresponds to the neighbor ID B000UHI2LW) has one associated item: B000VL7EW0. This might be the actual co-viewed item. However, this approach seems inefficient as I would need to do this for all 24 neighbor IDs, and it's unclear if this is the correct interpretation. Let me reconsider the problem. The question specifically asks for "co-viewed items," which should be item nodes connected via "also_viewed_item" relationships. The fact that the neighbor IDs are being retrieved as brand nodes suggests there might be an issue with the graph structure or my understanding. Let me try to directly get the title features of these neighbor IDs, treating them as item nodes despite the retrieval results.
Action 15: Thought 15: I need to reconsider my approach. The question asks for co-viewed items and specifies to provide node main features (names/titles). The issue seems to be that when I retrieve the neighbor IDs from the "also_viewed_item" relationship, they are being mapped to brand nodes. However, according to the graph definition, "also_viewed_item" should link to other item nodes. Let me try to directly query the title feature of these neighbor IDs as if they were item nodes, ignoring the retrieval results that show them as brand nodes.
Observation 15:
Correct answer: 36
