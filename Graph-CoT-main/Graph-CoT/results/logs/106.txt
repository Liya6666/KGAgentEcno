Question: What is the item that has over 4 products frequently bought along with Joyce Chen 33-2048 Burnished Bamboo Angled Spatula, 14-Inch?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the item that has over 4 products frequently bought along with Joyce Chen 33-2048 Burnished Bamboo Angled Spatula, 14-Inch? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for an item that has over 4 products frequently bought along with "Joyce Chen 33-2048 Burnished Bamboo Angled Spatula, 14-Inch". First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Joyce Chen 33-2048 Burnished Bamboo Angled Spatula, 14-Inch]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_643.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned a brand node (brand_643) instead of an item node. This suggests that the item name might be slightly different in the graph. I should try to retrieve the item node more specifically, perhaps by using a different keyword or checking if there's an item with a similar name.
Action 2: Thought 2: The observation returned a brand node (brand_643), but I need to find the item node for "Joyce Chen 33-2048 Burnished Bamboo Angled Spatula, 14-Inch". Since brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, I can find the items associated with this brand and then look for the specific item.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: Since I got a brand node instead of the item node, I should first find the items associated with this brand. Let me get the items linked to brand_643.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_643, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_643 are: ['B0006PUYLY']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now I have an item node ID 'B0006PUYLY' associated with brand_643. I should verify if this is the correct item by checking its title feature to confirm it matches "Joyce Chen 33-2048 Burnished Bamboo Angled Spatula, 14-Inch".
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B0006PUYLY, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B0006PUYLY are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature returned seems to be incomplete or malformed. I should try to retrieve the node again with a more specific query or check if there are other items associated with the brand. Alternatively, I can try to retrieve the item node using a different approach, such as searching for part of the item name.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Joyce Chen 33-2048 Burnished Bamboo Angled Spatula]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007AVIC.
Thought 6: Thought 6: Now I have a different item node ID 'B00007AVIC'. I should verify if this is the correct item by checking its title feature to confirm it matches "Joyce Chen 33-2048 Burnished Bamboo Angled Spatula, 14-Inch".
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00007AVIC, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00007AVIC are: Australian Patchwork &amp; Quilting. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The title "Australian Patchwork & Quilting" doesn't match the Joyce Chen spatula item. This suggests that my retrieval is not finding the correct item. Let me try a more specific query for the exact item name.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Joyce Chen 33-2048 Burnished Bamboo Angled Spatula 14-Inch]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_643.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm still getting the brand node instead of the item. Let me try a different approach. Since I know the brand is Joyce Chen (from the item name), I can first find the Joyce Chen brand node and then look for its items. Then I can check each item's title to find the exact match for "Joyce Chen 33-2048 Burnished Bamboo Angled Spatula, 14-Inch".
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Joyce Chen]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000RFQ1LA.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I retrieved "Joyce Chen" and got node ID B000RFQ1LA. I should check if this is a brand node or an item node by examining its features or neighbor types. If it's a brand node, I can get its items; if it's an item, I might need to adjust my approach.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B000RFQ1LA, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B000RFQ1LA are: Sandra Knitting - English ed. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The node B000RFQ1LA appears to be an item node (it has a title feature), not a brand node. This suggests that "Joyce Chen" might be both a brand name and part of item titles. I need to find the Joyce Chen brand node specifically. Let me try to retrieve the brand node by using "brand" as a keyword or by checking the neighbor types of the item nodes I have.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[brand Joyce Chen]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_825.
Thought 11: Thought 11: Now I have a brand node ID 'brand_825' for Joyce Chen. I should verify this is the correct brand by checking its name feature, and then find all items associated with this brand to locate the specific spatula item.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[brand_825, name]
Observation 11: The name feature of brand_825 are: Don Diva Entertainment. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The brand node 'brand_825' has the name "Don Diva Entertainment", which is not Joyce Chen. This indicates that my retrieval for "brand Joyce Chen" did not find the correct brand. I need to find the Joyce Chen brand node more accurately. Since the item name includes "Joyce Chen", I should look for items with that in the title and then find their brand node, which should be Joyce Chen.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[Joyce Chen 33-2048]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_374.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. Let me try a different approach. Since the item name is long, I should try to find the item by its specific model number or a unique part of the name. Let me try "33-2048" which appears to be the model number.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[33-2048]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_552.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I keep getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable by its full name. Let me try a different strategy. Since the question mentions "frequently bought along with", I should look for the bought_together_item neighbors of the Joyce Chen spatula item. But first, I need to find the correct item node. Let me try to find all items that have "Joyce Chen" in their title by checking the neighbor items of the brand nodes I found, or by trying a broader search.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Burnished Bamboo Angled Spatula]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_297.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the specific item. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable by its full name in the graph. Let me try a different approach: I'll look for the brand node that actually represents Joyce Chen by checking the name features of the brand nodes I've encountered so far (brand_643, brand_825, brand_374, brand_552, brand_297) to see if any of them have "Joyce Chen" as their name.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[brand_643, name]
Observation 15: The name feature of brand_643 are: Americas Test Kitchen.
Correct answer: Joyce Chen 33-2013 Burnished Bamboo Rice Paddle, 9-Inch
