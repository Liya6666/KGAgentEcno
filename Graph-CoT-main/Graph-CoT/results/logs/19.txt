Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted with HTML tags ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?"). I need to first identify the correct item node. Since the title seems malformed, I should try to retrieve the node using the visible text portion, though it might not match exactly.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[a-size-medium a-color-secondary]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The retrieval returned a node ID B00005N7NQ, which suggests that "a-size-medium a-color-secondary" might be part of the item's title or description. However, the question specifically asks for the price of the item, and I should verify that this node is indeed an item node and then retrieve its price feature.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, price]
Observation 2: The price feature of B00005N7NQ are: . 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The price feature returned empty, which suggests that either the node ID B00005N7NQ is not an item node, or the price information is missing. Since the question asks for the price of an item, I should first verify the node type by checking its features. If it's an item node, perhaps the price is stored under a different feature key, or I need to check the title to confirm it's the correct item.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title feature confirms that this node has the exact text from the question as its title. However, the price feature was empty. I should check if this node has other item features like category or description to confirm it's an item node. If it is indeed an item node but price is missing, I might need to look for alternative ways to find the price, such as checking related items or the brand's items.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 4: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The category feature confirms that B00005N7NQ is indeed an item node. However, the price feature was empty. Since the question specifically asks for the price, I need to find alternative ways to obtain this information. Perhaps this item is linked to other items through relationships like also_viewed_item or also_bought_item, and I can check the prices of those related items. Alternatively, I should check if this item has a brand relationship and see if other items from the same brand have price information that might be similar.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 5: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The item has a brand relationship with brand_0. I should check what other items are linked to this brand, as they might have similar pricing or I might find the correct price information for this specific item through its brand connections.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[brand_0, item]
Observation 6: The item neighbors of brand_0 are: ['B00005N7NQ']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The brand_0 has only one item neighbor, which is B00005N7NQ itself. This means there are no other items from this brand to compare prices with. Since the price feature for this item is empty, I should check other relationship types to see if there are related items that might have price information. Perhaps items that are also viewed or also bought with this item could provide pricing context.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 7: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I have a list of also_viewed_item neighbors for B00005N7NQ. Since the price feature for the original item is empty, I should check if any of these related items have price information. However, the question specifically asks for the price of the given item, not related items. I should first verify if there might be an alternative way to get the price for B00005N7NQ itself. Perhaps I should check other features or relationships.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 8: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The description confirms this is an item (a magazine subscription to "REASON"). However, the price feature remains empty. Since the question specifically asks for the price of this item, and I cannot find it directly, I should check if there might be a buy_after_viewing_item relationship or other relationships that could provide pricing information. Alternatively, I could check if any of the also_viewed_items have similar titles or categories that might indicate they are the same product with price information.
Action 9: Thought 9: Since the price feature for B00005N7NQ is empty, I should check if any of the also_viewed_item neighbors might actually be the same product with price information. I could retrieve the title features of some of these related items to see if they match the original item's title more completely or have price information.
Observation 9: 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I need to check if any of the also_viewed_item neighbors have titles that match the original item's title more completely, as they might be the same product with price information. Let me start by checking the title of one of the related items to see if it provides more complete information.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 10: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I made an error in Action 10. I should not use "also_viewed_item" as a feature name. Instead, I should check the title feature of one of the also_viewed_item neighbors to see if they might be related products with price information. Let me check the title of the first also_viewed_item neighbor.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 11: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I need to verify that B000UHI2LW is actually a node in the graph. Since the observation says the node or feature name does not exist, I should first retrieve the node using its ID to confirm it exists, or check if I need to use the correct node ID format.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 13: Thought 13: The retrieval shows that B000UHI2LW is actually a brand node (brand_756), not an item node. This suggests that the also_viewed_item neighbors might include both item and brand nodes, or there might be an issue with how I'm interpreting the neighbor list. I should check what type of node B00005N7NQ is connected to as also_viewed_item. Let me verify the node type of one of the other also_viewed_item neighbors.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[B002PXW18E]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 14: Thought 14: It appears that the also_viewed_item neighbors I retrieved earlier are actually brand nodes, not item nodes. This suggests that when I used NeighbourCheck with "also_viewed_item", it returned brand nodes instead of item nodes. I should verify the node type of B00005N7NQ and check what relationships it actually has. Let me first confirm what type of node B00005N7NQ is by checking its features more carefully.
Action 14: Thought 14: I need to verify the node type of B00005N7NQ. Since it has features like title, description, and category, it should be an item node. However, the also_viewed_item neighbors appear to be brand nodes based on the retrieval results. This suggests that the graph might have different relationship types than I initially assumed, or there might be an error in how I'm interpreting the neighbor types. Let me check what relationship types are available for this node by trying different neighbor types.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I need to reconsider the relationships. The graph definition states that item nodes are linked to "also_viewed_item" nodes, but my observations suggest that the neighbors returned might be brand nodes. Let me try checking the "also_bought_item" relationship instead, as that might return actual item nodes with price information.
Action 15: Action 15: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 15: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK'].
