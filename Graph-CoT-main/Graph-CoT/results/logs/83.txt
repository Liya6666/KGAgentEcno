Question: What is the publisher of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the publisher of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the publisher of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?"). This might be a formatting issue. I need to first retrieve the node using the given text, though it may not be a standard title.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The retrieval was successful, and I have the item node ID B00005N7NQ. The question asks for the "publisher" of this item. However, according to the graph definition, items are linked to brands, not directly to publishers. In many e-commerce contexts, "publisher" might correspond to the "brand" for certain types of items (like books, media). I should check the item's brand neighbor to see if it represents the publisher.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 2: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I have found that the item is linked to brand_0. Now I need to get the name of this brand, as the question asks for the publisher and likely the brand name represents the publisher in this context. I should use NodeFeature to get the brand's name.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 3: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The brand name "Reason Magazine" appears to be the publisher for this item. Since the question specifically asks for the publisher and I've found the brand name, I should provide this as the answer.
Action 4: Finish[Reason Magazine]
Observation 4: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Future Publishing Ltd
