Question: Look for items that match the same brand and category as Wera Zyklop 8790 HMC 1/2&quot; Socket, Hex head 17mm x Length 37mm.
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Look for items that match the same brand and category as Wera Zyklop 8790 HMC 1/2&quot; Socket, Hex head 17mm x Length 37mm. Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for items that match the same brand and category as the item "Wera Zyklop 8790 HMC 1/2&quot; Socket, Hex head 17mm x Length 37mm". First, I need to find this item node in the graph to get its brand and category.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Wera Zyklop 8790 HMC 1/2" Socket, Hex head 17mm x Length 37mm]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_518.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned a brand node ID (brand_518) instead of an item node ID. This suggests that the item name might not be an exact match in the graph, or there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should try to retrieve the item node again with a slightly modified query, perhaps using a partial match or different phrasing.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Wera Zyklop 8790 HMC 1/2" Socket, Hex head 17mm x Length 37mm item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_518.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node instead of an item node. This suggests that the item name might not be stored exactly as given, or there might be a parsing issue with the special characters. I should try to retrieve the item using a more general keyword from the title, such as "Wera Zyklop" or "8790 HMC", to find the correct item node.
Action 3: RetrieveNode[Wera Zyklop 8790 HMC]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_846.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval is still returning brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable by its full title, or there might be an issue with how the graph is structured. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I should look for items that contain "Wera" in their title to find the correct item node.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[Wera]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_464.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item, which suggests that the item name might not be stored in the graph with the exact title provided. Let me try a different strategy - perhaps I should look for items that contain "Zyklop" or "8790" which might be more specific to this product.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Zyklop 8790]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand matches over item matches, or the item might not be stored with the exact title. Let me try a different approach - I should look for the brand first, then find items from that brand, and then identify the specific item from there.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Wera brand]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_728.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm still getting inconsistent brand IDs when trying to retrieve "Wera" brand. This suggests that the retrieval function might not be working as expected for this specific query. Let me try a different approach - I should look for items that contain "Socket" and "Hex" in their title, which might help me find the correct item node.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Socket Hex head 17mm]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_518.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve the specific item. This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand matches, or the item might not be stored with the exact title. Let me try a different approach - I should look for the brand first by using a more specific brand query, then find all items from that brand, and then identify the specific item from there.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Wera Zyklop brand]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_370.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item, which suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand matches. Let me try a different approach - I should look for items that contain "8790" in their title, as this seems to be a specific product number that might help identify the item.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[8790]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve the specific item. This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand matches, or the item might not be stored with the exact title. Let me try a different approach - I should look for the brand first by using a more specific brand query, then find all items from that brand, and then identify the specific item from there by checking their titles.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Wera brand name]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_603.
