Question: What is the average price of the co-viewed items with 18 INCH MOLLE COMPATIBLE MACHETE SHEATH-OD?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the average price of the co-viewed items with 18 INCH MOLLE COMPATIBLE MACHETE SHEATH-OD? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the average price of co-viewed items with "18 INCH MOLLE COMPATIBLE MACHETE SHEATH-OD". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[18 INCH MOLLE COMPATIBLE MACHETE SHEATH-OD]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000F3UPN4.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the co-viewed items for this item. Based on the graph definition, co-viewed items would likely be the "also_viewed_item" neighbors. I should retrieve these neighbors.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B000F3UPN4, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B000F3UPN4 are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that there are no also_viewed_item neighbors for this node. However, the question asks about "co-viewed items," which might refer to other relationship types like "buy_after_viewing_item" or "also_bought_item." I should check these alternative relationships to find co-viewed items.
Action 3: Thought 3: Since there are no "also_viewed_item" neighbors, I should check other relationship types that might represent co-viewed items, such as "buy_after_viewing_item" or "also_bought_item". Let me try these.
Observation 3: 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I need to check other relationship types that might represent co-viewed items. Let me try "buy_after_viewing_item" neighbors first.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B000F3UPN4, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 4: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B000F3UPN4 are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: Since both "also_viewed_item" and "buy_after_viewing_item" return empty lists, I should check other relationship types that might be relevant for co-viewed items, such as "also_bought_item" or "bought_together_item". Let me try "also_bought_item" next.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B000F3UPN4, also_bought_item]
Observation 5: The also_bought_item neighbors of B000F3UPN4 are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: All the common relationship types for co-viewed items (also_viewed_item, buy_after_viewing_item, also_bought_item) are returning empty lists. Let me try the remaining relationship type "bought_together_item" to see if there are any neighbors that might be considered co-viewed items.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B000F3UPN4, bought_together_item]
Observation 6: The bought_together_item neighbors of B000F3UPN4 are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: It appears that the item "18 INCH MOLLE COMPATIBLE MACHETE SHEATH-OD" has no neighbors of any type that could be considered co-viewed items (also_viewed_item, buy_after_viewing_item, also_bought_item, or bought_together_item). Therefore, there are no co-viewed items to calculate an average price for. The average price would be undefined or zero in this case.
Action 7: Thought 7: Since there are no co-viewed items (no neighbors of any relevant type), the average price cannot be calculated. I should return an appropriate response indicating that there are no co-viewed items.
Observation 7: 
Thought 8: Thought 8: Before concluding that there are no co-viewed items, I should double-check if I have the correct node. The question mentions "co-viewed items," which typically refers to items that are viewed together, similar to "also_viewed_item." Since all neighbor types returned empty lists, I should verify if the node exists and has any connections. Let me check the node's degree for all relationship types to confirm.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeDegree[B000F3UPN4, also_viewed_item]
Observation 8: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B000F3UPN4 are: 0. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The node degree for also_viewed_item is 0, confirming there are no co-viewed items. I should also check if there might be any other relationship types that could be considered for co-viewed items, but based on the graph definition, the relevant types are also_viewed_item, buy_after_viewing_item, also_bought_item, and bought_together_item. Since all of these have no neighbors, there are indeed no co-viewed items for this node. Therefore, the average price cannot be calculated.
Action 9: Finish[No co-viewed items found for the given item, so average price cannot be calculated.]
Observation 9: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 23.57
