Question: Which items from publisher Truth Consciousness have the most also-viewed items?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which items from publisher Truth Consciousness have the most also-viewed items? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items from a specific publisher (Truth Consciousness) and wants to know which of these items have the most also-viewed items. First, I need to find the brand node for "Truth Consciousness" since "publisher" likely refers to a brand in this context.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Truth Consciousness]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_445.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the brand node ID. I need to find all items linked to this brand. Then I'll need to check the number of also_viewed_item neighbors for each of these items to determine which has the most.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_445, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_445 are: ['B00007AZ93']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I see that brand_445 has only one item neighbor: B00007AZ93. Since there's only one item from this publisher, it automatically has the most also-viewed items by default. Now I need to get the title/name of this item to answer the question.
Action 3: NodeFeature[B00007AZ93, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00007AZ93 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title feature seems to contain HTML markup. I need to extract the actual title text. Let me try getting the title feature again, or perhaps check if there's a cleaner way to get the item's name. Since the question asks for the main feature (e.g., names), I should get the proper title.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00007AZ93, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00007AZ93 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature appears to be returning HTML markup rather than clean text. Let me try getting the description or category feature to see if they contain the actual item name, or perhaps the issue is with how the title is stored. I should also verify that this is indeed the correct item node.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00007AZ93, description]
Observation 5: The description feature of B00007AZ93 are: ["LIGHT OF CONSCIOUSNESS in its 26th year, has been called 'the most spiritual magazine on the market' -John Allan. Each issue offers outstanding transformational articles and wisdom to inspire your path, including spiritual practices, meditation, healing and conscious living."]. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The description confirms this is a publication from Truth Consciousness. Since I need the item's name/title but the title feature seems problematic, let me try the category feature or see if there's another way to get the item's main identifier. I should also check if this item has any also_viewed_item neighbors to confirm it has the most (which it does by default since it's the only item).
Action 6: Action 6: NodeDegree[B00007AZ93, also_viewed_item]
Observation 6: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00007AZ93 are: 39. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: Now I have confirmed that this item has 39 also_viewed_item neighbors. Since it's the only item from publisher Truth Consciousness, it automatically has the most also-viewed items. I still need to provide the item's name/main feature. The title feature seems to be returning HTML markup, but the description clearly identifies the item as "LIGHT OF CONSCIOUSNESS" magazine. Let me try getting the category feature to see if it provides a cleaner title, or I can use the description to extract the name.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00007AZ93, category]
Observation 7: The category feature of B00007AZ93 are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Health, Fitness & Wellness', 'Women']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The category confirms this is a magazine subscription, but doesn't give me the specific title. The description clearly states "LIGHT OF CONSCIOUSNESS" as the publication name. Since the title feature appears to be problematic (returning HTML markup instead of clean text), I should use the description to identify the item. The item is "LIGHT OF CONSCIOUSNESS" magazine from Truth Consciousness, and it has 39 also-viewed items, which is the most (and only) among Truth Consciousness items.
Action 8: Finish[LIGHT OF CONSCIOUSNESS magazine]
Observation 8: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
