Question: What is the number of also-bought items connected to the item WOMENS SKAGEN STEEL MESH DRESSY MOP NEW WATCH 358SMMD?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the number of also-bought items connected to the item WOMENS SKAGEN STEEL MESH DRESSY MOP NEW WATCH 358SMMD? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of also-bought items for a specific item node (WOMENS SKAGEN STEEL MESH DRESSY MOP NEW WATCH 358SMMD). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[WOMENS SKAGEN STEEL MESH DRESSY MOP NEW WATCH 358SMMD]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the node ID for the item. The question asks for the number of also-bought items connected to this item. I should use the NodeDegree function to get the count of its "also_bought_item" neighbors.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00007J82Z, also_bought_item]
Observation 2: The also_bought_item neighbor node degree of B00007J82Z are: 0. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the also_bought_item neighbor degree is 0, which seems unusual. I should verify this by checking the actual neighbors to ensure there are no also_bought_item connections. Let me use NeighbourCheck to list the also_bought_item neighbors.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00007J82Z, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00007J82Z are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The observation confirms there are no also_bought_item neighbors for this item. However, the question asks for the number of also-bought items, and I should provide the answer based on the graph information. Since there are no also_bought_item neighbors, the number is 0.
Action 4: Finish[0]
Observation 4: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 0
