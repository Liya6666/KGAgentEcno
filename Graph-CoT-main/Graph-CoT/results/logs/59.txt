Question: Can you tell me how many items are purchased after viewing Chemistry?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you tell me how many items are purchased after viewing Chemistry? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items purchased after viewing an item called "Chemistry". First, I need to find the node for the item "Chemistry" in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Chemistry]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_295.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_295" which appears to be a brand node, not an item node. The question is asking about items purchased after viewing an item called "Chemistry", so I need to find the item node with the title "Chemistry". I should try a more specific search.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Chemistry item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_295.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The RetrieveNode function seems to be returning a brand node instead of an item node for "Chemistry". I need to try a different approach. Since "Chemistry" might be the title of an item, I should look for items that have "Chemistry" in their title by using a more specific keyword or consider that there might be multiple items with similar names. Let me try to search with a more complete title if possible, or consider that "Chemistry" might be a brand name rather than an item title.
Action 3: Thought 3: The RetrieveNode function is returning a brand node for "Chemistry", which suggests that "Chemistry" might be a brand name rather than an item title. However, the question specifically asks about "items purchased after viewing Chemistry", which implies "Chemistry" is an item. Let me try to search for items that might have "Chemistry" in their title by using a different keyword or consider that the item might have a longer title.
Observation 3: 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Since RetrieveNode["Chemistry"] returns a brand node (brand_295), it suggests that "Chemistry" is likely a brand name rather than an item title. However, the question asks about "items purchased after viewing Chemistry", which implies "Chemistry" should be an item. I need to find if there are any items with "Chemistry" in their title. Let me try to search for items related to chemistry with a more specific query.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Chemistry book]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_523.
Thought 5: Thought 5: This is still returning brand nodes. I need to reconsider the approach. Since "Chemistry" appears to be a brand name rather than an item title, perhaps the question is asking about items purchased after viewing items from the Chemistry brand. Let me check the brand node's features to confirm this interpretation.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[brand_295, name]
Observation 5: The name feature of brand_295 are: New Scientist Ltd. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The brand_295 node has the name "New Scientist Ltd.", which doesn't match "Chemistry". Let me try a different approach. Since "Chemistry" might be part of an item title, I should look for items that have "Chemistry" in their title by checking the brand_295's items first, as it was returned for "Chemistry" query, but that might not be relevant. Let me try a more specific search for an item with "Chemistry" in the title.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Chemistry: A Molecular Approach]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_295.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The RetrieveNode function keeps returning brand_295 for various chemistry-related queries, which suggests there might be an issue with the search function or the graph structure. Let me try a different approach. Since "Chemistry" might be a brand, but the question asks about items purchased after viewing "Chemistry" (likely an item), I should look for items that have "Chemistry" in their title by examining the brand_295's items, as it was returned for chemistry queries, and see if any have "Chemistry" in their title.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[brand_295, item]
Observation 7: The item neighbors of brand_295 are: ['B00006KPU2']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: Now I have an item node ID 'B00006KPU2' that belongs to brand_295. I should check the title of this item to see if it contains "Chemistry" to confirm if this is the relevant item.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00006KPU2, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B00006KPU2 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title feature returned HTML code instead of a readable title. This suggests there might be an issue with the data. Let me try to get the title in a different way or check if there are other items from this brand. Since the question is about "Chemistry" and brand_295 was returned for chemistry queries, perhaps this is the correct brand. Let me check the name of brand_295 again to confirm what it represents.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[brand_295, name]
Observation 9: The name feature of brand_295 are: New Scientist Ltd. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The brand_295 has name "New Scientist Ltd." which doesn't seem directly related to "Chemistry". However, since RetrieveNode keeps returning brand_295 for chemistry-related queries, there might be items under this brand that have "Chemistry" in their title. Let me check the title of the item B00006KPU2 more carefully or try to find other items from this brand. Perhaps I need to look for items with "Chemistry" in their title by checking the category or description features.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00006KPU2, description]
Observation 10: The description feature of B00006KPU2 are: ['New Scientist is the world s most read weekly science and technology magazine. New Scientist reports on the very latest science and technology news, putting discoveries and advances in the context of everyday life.']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The description of item B00006KPU2 is about "New Scientist" magazine, not specifically about chemistry. This suggests that brand_295 (New Scientist Ltd.) may not be the correct node for "Chemistry". I need to try a different approach to find the item "Chemistry". Let me try searching with a more specific query that might match an item title exactly.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode["Chemistry textbook"]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_523.
Thought 12: Thought 12: The RetrieveNode function keeps returning brand nodes for chemistry-related queries, which suggests that "Chemistry" might not be a specific item title in the graph. However, the question asks about "items purchased after viewing Chemistry", implying that "Chemistry" should be an item. Let me try a different approach: perhaps "Chemistry" is part of a longer item title. I should search for items that have "Chemistry" in their title by checking the category or using a broader search, but since RetrieveNode is not working as expected, I might need to consider that "Chemistry" could be a brand name, and the question might be referring to items from the Chemistry brand.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode["Chemistry brand"]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_751.
Thought 13: Thought 13: The RetrieveNode function is returning various brand nodes for chemistry-related queries, but none seem to directly match "Chemistry" as a brand name. Let me check the name of brand_751 to see if it's actually the "Chemistry" brand.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[brand_751, name]
Observation 13: The name feature of brand_751 are: Medien Innovation Gmbh. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The RetrieveNode function is not returning a direct match for "Chemistry" as an item or brand name. Given the observations, it seems that "Chemistry" might not be a specific node in the graph, or the search function is not working as expected. However, the question asks about items purchased after viewing "Chemistry", which implies that "Chemistry" should be an item. Since direct searches are not yielding the correct item node, I should consider that "Chemistry" might be part of a longer title or a common keyword. Let me try to search for an item that has "Chemistry" in its title by using a different approach, such as looking for items in a category related to chemistry or checking the description.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode["Chemistry set"]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_643.
Thought 15: Thought 15: The RetrieveNode function continues to return brand nodes for chemistry-related queries, which suggests that "Chemistry" might not be a specific item title in the graph. However, the question is asking about items purchased after viewing "Chemistry", implying it should be an item. Given the challenges with RetrieveNode, I should consider that "Chemistry" might be a brand name, and the question might be referring to items from the Chemistry brand. Let me check if there is a brand with the exact name "Chemistry".
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode["Chemistry"]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_547.
Correct answer: 4
