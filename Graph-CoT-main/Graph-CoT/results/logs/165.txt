Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['South of the Border, West of the Sun', 'Legend', 'Lowboy: A Novel', 'The Plot Against America: A Novel', 'Ruins']?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['South of the Border, West of the Sun', 'Legend', 'Lowboy: A Novel', 'The Plot Against America: A Novel', 'Ruins']? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a next item recommendation based on a user's history of items. The history contains book titles: 'South of the Border, West of the Sun', 'Legend', 'Lowboy: A Novel', 'The Plot Against America: A Novel', 'Ruins'. I need to find these items in the graph and then analyze their connections (like also_bought_item, bought_together_item) to find a common item that is frequently associated with them, which would be a good recommendation. First, I should retrieve the node IDs for each of these items.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[South of the Border, West of the Sun]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_916.
Thought 2: Thought 2: That's unexpected. The observation returned a brand node (brand_916) instead of an item node. The user history should consist of item nodes (books). I should verify if this is correct by checking the node's features to confirm its type. If it's indeed a brand, I need to find the actual item node for this book title.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_916, name]
Observation 2: The name feature of brand_916 are: Sunatoria. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation confirms that brand_916 is indeed a brand node (Sunatoria), not the book item "South of the Border, West of the Sun". This suggests that the initial retrieval might have matched a brand name instead of the item title. I need to refine my retrieval query or approach to find the actual item nodes for these book titles. Perhaps I should include more specific terms or check if there are multiple nodes with similar names.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[South of the Border, West of the Sun book]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_371.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand matches over item titles. I need a different approach. Since these are book titles, I should try to find item nodes by their exact titles. Perhaps I need to be more specific or check if there are multiple nodes. Let me try retrieving one of the other book titles to see if I get better results.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Legend]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_888.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve these book titles. This suggests that the retrieval function might be matching brand names that contain these words rather than finding item nodes with these exact titles. I need to adjust my approach. Perhaps I should try to retrieve the items by including more specific context like "book" or "novel" in the query, or I should check if there are multiple nodes and filter for item types. Let me try a more specific query for one of the books.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[The Plot Against America: A Novel]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_689.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes, which suggests the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand name matches. Since these are book titles, I need to find the actual item nodes. Let me try a different approach - I'll retrieve nodes with more specific book-related terms or try to find items by checking if there are multiple nodes with similar names and filtering for item types. Let me try retrieving "Ruins" with "book" specification.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Ruins book]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B001P79SQY.
Thought 7: Thought 7: Great! I finally got an item node ID (B001P79SQY) for "Ruins book". This confirms that I need to be more specific in my retrieval queries by including "book" or other relevant terms. Now I should retrieve the other book titles with similar specificity to get their item node IDs.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[South of the Border, West of the Sun book]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_371.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm still getting brand nodes for some queries even with "book" added. Let me try different variations. For "South of the Border, West of the Sun," maybe I should try "South of the Border West of the Sun novel" or check if there are multiple matches. Let me try a different book title first.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Lowboy: A Novel book]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_489.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm still getting brand nodes even with "book" added to the queries. This suggests that the retrieval function might be matching brand names that contain these words. Let me try a different approach - I'll retrieve "Legend book" to see if I can get an item node, similar to how "Ruins book" worked.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Legend book]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_489.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm consistently getting brand nodes for most queries, except for "Ruins book" which returned an item node (B001P79SQY). This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand name matches when multiple nodes contain similar keywords. Since I need to find item nodes for these book titles, I should try a different strategy. Let me first examine the "Ruins" item node I found to understand its features and connections, which might give me clues about how to find the other items or directly help with the recommendation.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B001P79SQY, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B001P79SQY are: Nickelodeon Magazine November 2005 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The item node I found for "Ruins book" actually has a completely different title ("Nickelodeon Magazine November 2005 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"), which means my retrieval didn't actually find the correct "Ruins" book. This suggests that the retrieval function might be finding the best match based on keywords, but not necessarily the exact titles I'm looking for. I need to reconsider my approach. Perhaps these specific book titles don't exist as item nodes in the graph, or I need to use different search strategies. Let me try to find items by checking their category or description features that might contain these book titles. Alternatively, I could look for brand nodes related to book publishers and then find their items.
Action 11: Thought 11: Since direct retrieval of the exact book titles is not working, I need a different approach. The user's history consists of book titles, so I should look for item nodes that have these titles in their features (title, description, or category). Let me try to search for nodes with "novel" in their category or description, or try to find the specific books by searching with more precise queries including author names or ISBNs if possible. Alternatively, I could look for brand nodes that are book publishers and then explore their items.
Observation 11: 
Thought 12: Thought 12: Since direct retrieval of the exact book titles is not yielding the correct item nodes, I need to try a different approach. Perhaps I should search for these books using more specific identifiers or look for nodes that have "book" or "novel" in their category. Let me try to retrieve nodes by including the word "novel" more specifically, or check if there are nodes with these titles in their description features. I'll start with "The Plot Against America" which is a well-known novel.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[The Plot Against America novel]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_689.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand name matches over item titles. Since I need to find item nodes for these specific books, I should try a different strategy. Let me check if there are any item nodes with "book" or "novel" in their category feature, or try to find items by exploring brand nodes that might be book publishers. Alternatively, I could work with the nodes I have and try to find connections between them to make a recommendation, even if they're not the exact books mentioned.
Action 13: Thought 13: Since I'm having difficulty finding the exact item nodes for the specific book titles in the user's history, I need to reconsider my approach. Perhaps the graph doesn't contain these exact book titles as item nodes, or the retrieval function is prioritizing brand matches. For recommendation purposes, I could work with the nodes I've found (which appear to be brand nodes) and explore their connections to find related items. Let me first verify what type of nodes these brand IDs correspond to and then explore their item connections.
Observation 13: 
Thought 14: Thought 14: Since I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve the specific book titles, I should work with what I have. The user's history contains book titles, but the graph might not have exact item nodes for these specific books. However, for recommendation purposes, I can use the brand nodes I've found (which might be publishers or authors) to find related items. Let me first check the features of one of these brand nodes to understand what they represent, then explore their item connections to find books that could be recommended.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[brand_916, name]
Observation 14: The name feature of brand_916 are: Sunatoria. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The brand node brand_916 has the name "Sunatoria," which doesn't seem related to books or publishing. This suggests that the retrieval function might be incorrectly matching the book titles to unrelated brand nodes. Since I'm unable to find the exact item nodes for the specific books in the user's history, I need to try a completely different approach. Perhaps I should search for items that have "book" or "novel" in their category feature, or look for general book-related items in the graph. Let me try to find some book items by searching for common book-related terms.
Action 15: Thought 15: Since direct retrieval of the specific book titles is not working and is returning unrelated brand nodes, I need to change my approach entirely. The user's history consists of book titles, so I should look for item nodes that are books in general. I can search for nodes with "book" or "novel" in their category feature, or try to find book-related items through other means. Once I find some book items, I can analyze their connections to make a recommendation. Let me try to retrieve nodes with "book" in their category.
Observation 15:
