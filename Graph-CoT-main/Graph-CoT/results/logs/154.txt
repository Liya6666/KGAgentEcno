Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['Hustler Best Of Beaver Hunt #36 Magazine 2014', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"']?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['Hustler Best Of Beaver Hunt #36 Magazine 2014', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"']? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a next item recommendation based on a user's history. The history contains one clear item name ("Hustler Best Of Beaver Hunt #36 Magazine 2014") and several HTML-like strings which are likely not valid item titles. I should focus on the valid item name to find its node and then explore its connections (like also_viewed_item, also_bought_item) to find a relevant recommendation.
Action 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a next item recommendation based on a user's history. The history contains one clear item name ("Hustler Best Of Beaver Hunt #36 Magazine 2014") and several HTML-like strings which are likely not valid item titles. I should focus on the valid item name to find its node and then explore its connections (like also_viewed_item, also_bought_item) to find a relevant recommendation.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: I need to first retrieve the node for the valid item in the user's history: "Hustler Best Of Beaver Hunt #36 Magazine 2014". Then I can explore its connections to find commonly associated items that could be recommended.
Action 2: Action 2: RetrieveNode[Hustler Best Of Beaver Hunt #36 Magazine 2014]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00MZ7OSDQ.
Thought 3: Thought 3: Now that I have the node ID for the user's history item, I need to explore its connections to find relevant recommendations. Common recommendation approaches include looking at "also_viewed_item", "also_bought_item", or "buy_after_viewing_item" neighbors. I should start by checking what types of connections this item has.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00MZ7OSDQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00MZ7OSDQ are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The item has no also_viewed_item neighbors. I should try checking other relationship types like also_bought_item or buy_after_viewing_item to find potential recommendations.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B00MZ7OSDQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 4: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00MZ7OSDQ are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The item has no also_bought_item neighbors either. I should try checking the buy_after_viewing_item relationship type next.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00MZ7OSDQ, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 5: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00MZ7OSDQ are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: This item appears to have no connections through the typical recommendation relationships. I should check if it has any bought_together_item neighbors, or perhaps check its brand connections to find other items from the same brand that might be relevant.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00MZ7OSDQ, bought_together_item]
Observation 6: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00MZ7OSDQ are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: Since the item has no direct connections through typical recommendation relationships, I should check its brand connection. Items from the same brand might be relevant recommendations. Let me first find the brand of this item.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[B00MZ7OSDQ, brand]
Observation 7: The brand neighbors of B00MZ7OSDQ are: []. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: This item appears to be isolated in the graph with no connections to other items or brands. However, the user history contains several other entries that appear to be HTML fragments rather than proper item titles. Let me try to retrieve nodes using these HTML fragments to see if they correspond to actual items in the graph.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I successfully retrieved a node ID for one of the HTML fragments. This suggests these HTML strings might be item titles in the graph. Let me check the features of this node to understand what item it represents.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The node B00005N7NQ has a title that matches exactly the HTML fragment from the user history. This suggests that in this graph, items may have HTML-formatted titles. I should check if the other HTML fragments in the user history also correspond to item nodes. Let me retrieve nodes for the remaining HTML fragments to build a more complete user history.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">] (Note: I'll try retrieving one of the other identical HTML fragments)
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 11: Thought 11: All the HTML fragments in the user history appear to be identical and map to the same node (B00005N7NQ). This means the user history actually contains one distinct item ("Hustler Best Of Beaver Hunt #36 Magazine 2014") and multiple instances of another item represented by the HTML fragment. I should now explore connections from both of these items to find recommendation candidates.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 11: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: Great! I found that the HTML fragment item (B00005N7NQ) has many also_viewed_item neighbors. These would be good candidates for recommendation. I should check the titles of some of these neighbors to provide a meaningful recommendation. Since the user has viewed this item multiple times (based on the history containing multiple instances of the HTML fragment), items that are commonly viewed together would be relevant recommendations.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 12: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I tried to get the title feature of one of the also_viewed_item neighbors but got an error. The neighbor IDs might be item nodes, so I should check if they exist and have title features. Let me first verify if B000UHI2LW is a valid node by checking its features.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 13: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 14: Thought 14: The error suggests that B000UHI2LW might not be a valid node ID in the graph, or there might be an issue with how I'm querying. Let me try a different approach - first check if these neighbor IDs are valid by trying to retrieve their node features with a different feature, or try to get the title of one of the other neighbors.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B002PXW18E, title]
Observation 14: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm consistently getting errors when trying to access the title feature of the neighbor nodes. This suggests that either these neighbor IDs are not valid item nodes, or there's an issue with how I'm querying. Let me try a different approach - first verify if these neighbor IDs exist by trying to retrieve their basic node information or check if they have any features.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
