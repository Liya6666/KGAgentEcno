Question: What count of buy-after-viewing items does B+W 72mm Circular Polarizer have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What count of buy-after-viewing items does B+W 72mm Circular Polarizer have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the count of buy-after-viewing items for the item "B+W 72mm Circular Polarizer". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[B+W 72mm Circular Polarizer]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007B051.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the count of buy-after-viewing items for this node. The question asks for the count, so I should use NodeDegree to get the number of buy_after_viewing_item neighbors.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00007B051, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 2: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbor node degree of B00007B051 are: 0. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the buy_after_viewing_item neighbor degree is 0, meaning there are no buy-after-viewing items for this product. However, I should verify this by checking if there might be any neighbors of this type, as sometimes degree functions might not capture all relationships, or perhaps I need to use NeighbourCheck to list them.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00007B051, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 3: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00007B051 are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The NeighbourCheck confirms that there are no buy_after_viewing_item neighbors for this item. Therefore, the count is 0. Since the question asks for the count, I can provide the answer directly.
Action 4: Finish[0]
Observation 4: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 4
