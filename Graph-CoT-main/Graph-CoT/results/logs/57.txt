Question: How many also-bought items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many also-bought items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of also-bought items for a specific item, but the item name appears to be incomplete or possibly corrupted ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary""). This looks like it might be HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the correct item node using the given text, but I suspect this might not match any actual item node directly.

Observation 4: 
Thought 5: Thought 1: The question appears to have an issue - the item name seems to be corrupted HTML code ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"") rather than a proper item title. This might be a formatting error in the question. I should still attempt to retrieve the node using the given text, but it's unlikely to match any actual item node. Let me try the retrieval first.

Action 7: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I successfully retrieved a node with ID B00005N7NQ using the given text. Now I need to find out how many also_bought_item neighbors this item has. I should use the NodeDegree function to count the number of also_bought_item neighbors.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 8: The also_bought_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 38. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The question asks for the number of also-bought items, and I've found that there are 38 also_bought_item neighbors. However, the question also specifies "Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs." This suggests I need to provide the names/titles of these also-bought items, not just the count. I should retrieve the list of also_bought_item neighbors and then get their titles.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 9: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I have the list of also_bought_item neighbor IDs. Now I need to get the main feature (title) for each of these item nodes. Since there are 38 items, I should retrieve the title for each node ID. I'll need to use NodeFeature for each ID to get their titles.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B01MCU84LB, title]
Observation 10: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I received an error when trying to get the title feature for node B01MCU84LB. This suggests that either the node doesn't exist or "title" might not be the correct feature name. According to the graph definition, item nodes should have "title" as a feature. Let me try retrieving the node first to verify it exists, then try getting its title again.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[B01MCU84LB]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I see the issue now. When I tried to retrieve node B01MCU84LB, I got "brand_411" as the ID, which suggests that B01MCU84LB might be a brand node rather than an item node. However, the question is about also_bought_item neighbors, which should be item nodes. Let me check what type of node B00005N7NQ is first, and then verify the neighbor types.
Action 12: Thought 12: I need to verify what type of node B00005N7NQ is, since the neighbor retrieval returned what appears to be a mix of item and brand IDs. Let me first check the features of B00005N7NQ to confirm it's an item node.
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Thought 1: The question appears to have an issue - the item name seems to be corrupted HTML code ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"") rather than a proper item title. However, I should still attempt to retrieve the node using the given text as it appears in the question.
