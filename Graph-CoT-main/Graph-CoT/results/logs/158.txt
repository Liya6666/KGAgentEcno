Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', 'WWE Magazine January 2014 *John Cena*']?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', 'WWE Magazine January 2014 *John Cena*']? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a recommendation based on a user's history. The history contains several items with HTML-like titles, and one clear item title: "WWE Magazine January 2014 *John Cena*". The other entries seem to be malformed or incomplete. I should focus on the clear item title to find its node and then explore its connections (like also_bought_item or buy_after_viewing_item) to find a suitable recommendation. The final answer should be the title of a recommended item node.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[WWE Magazine January 2014 *John Cena*]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000VU90OQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have the node ID for the WWE Magazine item. To recommend a next item, I should look at items that are commonly associated with this one, such as items that are also bought together, bought after viewing, or also viewed. These relationships are likely to indicate good recommendations. I'll start by checking the "also_bought_item" neighbors, as these are often strong indicators of complementary products.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B000VU90OQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 2: The also_bought_item neighbors of B000VU90OQ are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The "also_bought_item" neighbors list is empty for this item. I should try other relationship types that might indicate recommendations. Let me check the "buy_after_viewing_item" neighbors, as these represent items that users typically purchase after viewing the current item.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B000VU90OQ, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 3: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B000VU90OQ are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Both "also_bought_item" and "buy_after_viewing_item" neighbors returned empty lists. I should try checking the "also_viewed_item" neighbors, as these might provide alternative items that users viewed in relation to this WWE Magazine. This could still serve as a reasonable recommendation.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B000VU90OQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 4: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B000VU90OQ are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: All the direct item-to-item relationships (also_bought_item, buy_after_viewing_item, also_viewed_item) returned empty lists. I should check if this item has a brand connection, and then explore items from the same brand as potential recommendations. This could be a valid approach since users often prefer items from brands they've previously purchased from.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B000VU90OQ, brand]
Observation 5: The brand neighbors of B000VU90OQ are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The item node B000VU90OQ appears to have no connections to other items or brands in the graph. This suggests it might be an isolated node or the relationships might be missing. I should try to retrieve the node using the other items in the user's history, even though they appear malformed. Perhaps the HTML-like strings correspond to actual item titles in the graph. Let me try retrieving nodes using those strings.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I successfully retrieved a node using one of the HTML-like strings. Now I should check what this item actually is by examining its title feature, and then explore its connections to find a recommendation.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The title feature appears to be the same HTML string used for retrieval, which suggests this might be a data quality issue. However, this item node exists in the graph and might have meaningful connections. I should explore its relationships to find potential recommendations. Let me check its "also_bought_item" neighbors first, as these typically provide strong recommendations.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 8: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I found a list of also_bought_item neighbors for the node B00005N7NQ. To provide a recommendation, I should select one of these items and retrieve its title feature to present as the recommended item. I'll choose the first neighbor in the list and get its title.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B01MCU84LB, title]
Observation 9: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I tried to get the title of the first also_bought_item neighbor (B01MCU84LB) but received an error. This might be because the node ID format is different or the node doesn't exist. Let me try retrieving the node using a different approach or check if I need to use the correct feature name. Since the question asks for the main feature (names), I should try to get the title of one of these neighbor nodes. Let me try with a different neighbor ID from the list.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00005NIOH, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B00005NIOH are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The title feature of B00005NIOH also returns the same HTML-like string, which isn't very informative for a recommendation. I should try a different neighbor that might have a proper title. Let me try another neighbor ID from the list.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[0345816021, title]
Observation 11: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm encountering issues with some node IDs not existing or not having proper title features. Let me try a different approach. Since the user's history contains multiple items with similar HTML-like titles, perhaps I should check if these items are connected to each other or explore other relationship types. Let me check the "bought_together_item" neighbors for the original WWE Magazine item, as this might provide complementary recommendations.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[B000VU90OQ, bought_together_item]
Observation 12: The bought_together_item neighbors of B000VU90OQ are: []. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The WWE Magazine item has no bought_together_item neighbors either. Let me go back to the also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ and try a different neighbor ID that might have a proper title. I'll try B001THPA26, which appears to be a standard Amazon-style product ID.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B001THPA26, title]
Observation 13: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently getting errors when trying to retrieve title features for the also_bought_item neighbors. This suggests that either these node IDs are invalid or there's an issue with how I'm querying them. Let me try a different approach - I'll check if these neighbor nodes exist by trying to retrieve them directly first, then get their features.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[B001THPA26]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_381.
Thought 15: Thought 15: Interesting - when I tried to retrieve B001THPA26, it returned a brand node (brand_381) instead of an item node. This suggests that the also_bought_item relationships might be connecting to brand nodes rather than item nodes, which is unexpected based on the graph definition. Let me check what type of node B001THPA26 actually is by examining its features. Since it's a brand node, I should get its name feature.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[brand_381, name]
Observation 15: The name feature of brand_381 are: Csicop.
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
