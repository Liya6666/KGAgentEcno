Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with a specific item. First, I need to identify the item node from the given title, which appears to be incomplete or malformed: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?". This might be an HTML fragment rather than a proper item title. I should try to retrieve the node using the provided text as is.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00005N7NQ) for the given item, I need to find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with it. "Co-viewed items" likely refers to items that are also_viewed_item neighbors. First, I should retrieve the also_viewed_item neighbors of this node to understand what items are co-viewed with it.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I now have the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for the target item. To find items that share over 4 co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ, I need to check each of these neighbor items and see how many also_viewed_item neighbors they have in common with B00005N7NQ. First, I should get the complete set of also_viewed_item neighbors for B00005N7NQ, then for each neighbor item, I need to retrieve its also_viewed_item neighbors and check the intersection size.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I see that the title feature of node B00005N7NQ is indeed the HTML fragment provided in the question. Now I need to find which items share over 4 co-viewed items with this node. I should iterate through the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ (which I already have from Observation 2), and for each of these neighbor items, I need to:
Action 4: Thought 4: I need to find which items share over 4 co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ. I should iterate through the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ, and for each neighbor item, retrieve its also_viewed_item neighbors, then check the intersection size with B00005N7NQ's also_viewed_item neighbors. If the intersection size is greater than 4, that neighbor item qualifies. I should also consider that the question might be asking about items in general, not just the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ. However, typically, items that share co-viewed items would be among the also_viewed_item neighbors themselves. Let me start with the neighbors I have.
Observation 4: 
Thought 5: Thought 5: I need to systematically check each also_viewed_item neighbor of B00005N7NQ to see how many co-viewed items they share with B00005N7NQ. For each neighbor node, I'll retrieve its also_viewed_item neighbors and calculate the intersection size with B00005N7NQ's also_viewed_item neighbors. If the intersection size is greater than 4, I'll record that item and its title.
Action 5: Action 5: Let me start with the first neighbor from Observation 2: B000UHI2LW. I'll retrieve its also_viewed_item neighbors.
Observation 5: 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I need to execute Action 5 to get the also_viewed_item neighbors of B000UHI2LW. Let me do that now.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B000UHI2LW, also_viewed_item]
Observation 6: The node or neighbor type does not exist in the graph. This might because your given neighbor type is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The neighbor type "also_viewed_item" might not be correct for this specific node. Let me check what neighbor types are available for item nodes. According to the graph definition, item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, and bought_together_item nodes. Perhaps I should try the correct neighbor type, which might be "also_viewed_item" as defined. Let me try with a different approach - first, let me verify the node exists and get its features.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 7: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 8: Thought 8: It seems that the node B000UHI2LW might not exist in the graph, or there might be an issue with the node ID. Let me try to retrieve the node using its title or check if I made an error. Since I got the list of also_viewed_item neighbors from B00005N7NQ in Observation 2, those nodes should exist. Let me try to retrieve one of them directly to verify.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I see the issue now. When I retrieved "B000UHI2LW" using RetrieveNode, it returned a brand node (brand_756) instead of an item node. This suggests that some of the neighbors listed in Observation 2 might be brand nodes rather than item nodes. However, according to the graph definition, also_viewed_item neighbors should be item nodes, not brand nodes. Let me check what type of neighbors I actually retrieved in Action 2.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 9: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I need to clarify what type of neighbors I retrieved in Action 2. The question mentions "co-viewed items," which should refer to also_viewed_item neighbors (item nodes). However, when I tried to check one of the neighbors (B000UHI2LW), it turned out to be a brand node. This suggests that the NeighbourCheck function in Action 2 might have returned a mix of item and brand neighbors, or there might be an issue with how I'm interpreting the results. Let me check the neighbor types available for B00005N7NQ more carefully.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 10: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 24. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The NodeDegree confirms that B00005N7NQ has 24 also_viewed_item neighbors. However, when I tried to check one of these neighbors (B000UHI2LW), it was identified as a brand node. This suggests that the neighbor IDs returned in Observation 2 might include both item and brand nodes, or there might be an issue with the graph structure. Let me try to check the type of one of these neighbors by examining its features to confirm whether it's an item or brand node.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, name]
Observation 11: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I need to determine if B000UHI2LW is an item or brand node. Brand nodes have a "name" feature, while item nodes have "title" feature. Let me try checking the title feature instead.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 12: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm encountering issues with the neighbor nodes. Let me try a different approach. Since the question asks about "co-viewed items," I should focus only on item nodes that are also_viewed_item neighbors. Let me first verify that B00005N7NQ is indeed an item node by checking its features.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 13: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I need to find which items share over 4 co-viewed items with B00005N7NQ. Since I'm having issues with the neighbor nodes, let me try a different approach. I should first get all the also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ, then for each neighbor that is actually an item node (not a brand node), I'll check its also_viewed_item neighbors and find the intersection size. Let me start by getting the list of also_viewed_item neighbors again and then check each one's type.
Action 14: Thought 14: I need to systematically check each also_viewed_item neighbor of B00005N7NQ to determine which ones are item nodes and then find those that share over 4 co-viewed items. Let me first retrieve the list of also_viewed_item neighbors again, then for each neighbor, check if it's an item node by trying to access its title feature. If it's an item node, I'll retrieve its also_viewed_item neighbors and calculate the intersection size with B00005N7NQ's also_viewed_item neighbors.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I need to systematically check each also_viewed_item neighbor of B00005N7NQ. For each neighbor, I'll first verify if it's an item node by checking if it has a title feature. If it does, I'll retrieve its also_viewed_item neighbors and calculate the intersection size with B00005N7NQ's also_viewed_item neighbors. If the intersection size is greater than 4, I'll record that item's title.
Action 15: Action 15: Let me start by retrieving the list of also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ again to ensure I have the correct list.
Observation 15:
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
