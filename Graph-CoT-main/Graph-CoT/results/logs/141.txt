Question: What is the average number of also-bought items for magazines in category Lifestyle & Cultures?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the average number of also-bought items for magazines in category Lifestyle & Cultures? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the average number of also-bought items for magazines in the category "Lifestyle & Cultures". First, I need to find all item nodes that are magazines and belong to the "Lifestyle & Cultures" category. Then, for each of these items, I need to find the number of also_bought_item neighbors. Finally, I'll calculate the average of these numbers.
Action 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the average number of also-bought items for magazines in the category "Lifestyle & Cultures". First, I need to find all item nodes that are magazines and belong to the "Lifestyle & Cultures" category. However, I don't have a direct way to retrieve nodes by category. I might need to find some magazine items first and then check their categories.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: Since I need to find items in a specific category, I should first try to find some magazine items and check their categories to see if they match "Lifestyle & Cultures". I can start by retrieving a node with "magazine" in its title to get an initial item node.
Action 2: Thought 2: I need to find magazine items in the "Lifestyle & Cultures" category. Since I can't directly query by category, I should start by finding magazine items and then filter by category. Let me search for magazine items first.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to find magazine items. Let me start by searching for nodes with "magazine" in their title to identify magazine items.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[magazine]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0018L5RJY.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I found a node with ID B0018L5RJY when searching for "magazine". Now I need to check if this is actually a magazine item and what its category is. I should examine its features, particularly the category.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B0018L5RJY, category]
Observation 4: The category feature of B0018L5RJY are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: This node doesn't seem to be in the "Lifestyle & Cultures" category. I need to find magazine items specifically in that category.

Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Lifestyle & Cultures magazine]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_842.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I retrieved a brand node (brand_842) instead of an item node when searching for "Lifestyle & Cultures magazine". This isn't helpful for finding magazine items in that category. I need a different approach. Let me try to find magazine items more broadly and then check their categories.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[magazine Lifestyle & Cultures]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_842.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I keep getting brand nodes when searching for "Lifestyle & Cultures magazine". This approach isn't working. I need to think differently.
