Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which is the favourite category of the items commonly purchased with Vktech High Quality City Night View Bathing Waterproof Bathroom Fabric Shower Curtain? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the favorite category of items commonly purchased with a specific item. First, I need to find the node for "Vktech High Quality City Night View Bathing Waterproof Bathroom Fabric Shower Curtain".
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Vktech High Quality City Night View Bathing Waterproof Bathroom Fabric Shower Curtain]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_307.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_307" which appears to be a brand node, not an item node. This suggests that the retrieval might have matched a brand name instead of the item title. I should try to retrieve the item node again with a more precise query or check if there's an item with this title.
Action 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_307" which appears to be a brand node, not an item node.

Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Vktech High Quality City Night View Bathower Curtain]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_307.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval is still returning a brand node. This suggests that the item title might not be an exact match in the graph. Let me try to retrieve using a different approach - perhaps by searching for keywords that are more likely to be in an item title, like "Shower Curtain" or "City Night View".

Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007AVIC.
Thought 5: Thought 5: Great! Now I have an item node ID: B00007AVIC. The question is about items commonly purchased with this shower curtain. "Commonly purchased" likely refers to the "also_bought_item" or "bought_together_item" relationships. I should check both to find related items.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00007AVIC, also_bought_item]
Observation 5: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00007AVIC are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The also_bought_item neighbors list is empty. Let me check the bought_together_item neighbors instead, as that might contain the commonly purchased items.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00007AVIC, bought_together_item]
Observation 6: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00007AVIC are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: Both also_bought_item and bought_together_item neighbors are empty. Let me check other relationship types that might indicate commonly purchased items, such as also_viewed_item or buy_after_viewing_item, as these might also contain relevant items.

Observation 7: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00007AVIC are: []. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: All the relationship checks for commonly purchased items are returning empty lists.
