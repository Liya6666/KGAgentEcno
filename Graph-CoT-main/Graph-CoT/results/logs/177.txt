Question: What is the precise item that corresponds to this query: dunkaroo oreos?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the precise item that corresponds to this query: dunkaroo oreos? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the precise item that corresponds to "dunkaroo oreos". I need to find an item node that matches this query. Since "dunkaroo oreos" likely refers to a product name, I should search for it directly using RetrieveNode.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[dunkaroo oreos]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_728.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The retrieval returned a brand node (brand_728) instead of an item node. The question specifically asks for an "item" that corresponds to "dunkaroo oreos". I need to find items associated with this brand. I should check what items are linked to this brand node.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_728, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_728 are: ['B000INCK4I', 'B005DNAMPM', 'B005DNA3LU', 'B005DNCFP2', 'B005DNCU20', 'B005DNB4SG']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I have multiple item nodes associated with the brand "dunkaroo oreos". The question asks for "the precise item" that corresponds to this query, implying there might be one specific item that best matches "dunkaroo oreos". I should examine the features (especially title) of these items to determine which one is the most relevant match for "dunkaroo oreos".
Action 3: NodeFeature[B000INCK4I, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B000INCK4I are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title feature returned appears to be HTML code rather than the actual product title. This suggests I need to try a different approach. Let me check the title feature for another item node to see if I can get a proper product name.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B005DNAMPM, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B005DNAMPM are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm getting HTML code instead of actual product titles when querying the title feature. This suggests the title feature might contain HTML markup. I should try querying the description feature instead, as it might contain the actual product name in a more readable format.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B000INCK4I, description]
Observation 5: The description feature of B000INCK4I are: ['The favorite life-style magazine of country-loving women for 40 years is filled with delicious country recipes, affordable decorating ideas, easy-to-make crafts, green-thumb advice for your gardens and wholesome humor.']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The description doesn't seem to match "dunkaroo oreos" - it's describing a magazine. Let me try checking the category feature to better understand what these items are, or try another item node. Perhaps I should check the title feature more carefully - maybe I need to extract the text content from the HTML.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B005DNA3LU, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B005DNA3LU are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm consistently getting HTML markup instead of readable product titles. This suggests the title feature might contain HTML that needs to be parsed. However, since I can't parse HTML in this environment, I should try a different approach. Let me check if "dunkaroo oreos" might actually be a brand name, and then look for the most relevant item by examining other features like description or category. Alternatively, I should check if there's an item node that directly matches "dunkaroo oreos" using a different keyword search.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[oreos]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0000ARXXS.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I found an item node (B0000ARXXS) when searching for "oreos". This might be more relevant to the query "dunkaroo oreos". Let me check the features of this item node to see if it matches the query.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B0000ARXXS, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B0000ARXXS are: Everyday Food. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title "Everyday Food" doesn't seem to match "dunkaroo oreos". Let me check the description and category features of this item to better understand what it is.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B0000ARXXS, description]
Observation 9: The description feature of B0000ARXXS are: []. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The description is empty. Let me check the category feature to understand what this item is about.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B0000ARXXS, category]
Observation 10: The category feature of B0000ARXXS are: []. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm having difficulty finding the precise item for "dunkaroo oreos". Let me try a different approach. Since "dunkaroo oreos" is likely a specific product, I should search for it as a complete phrase. Let me also check if there are any other item nodes associated with the brand_728 that might contain "dunkaroo" or "oreos" in their features.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B005DNCFP2, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B005DNCFP2 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm consistently getting HTML markup instead of readable titles when querying the item nodes. This suggests the title feature contains HTML that needs to be parsed. Since I cannot parse HTML in this environment, I should try a different approach. Let me check the description features of the remaining item nodes associated with brand_728 to see if any contain "dunkaroo" or "oreos" in their descriptions.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B005DNCU20, description]
Observation 12: The description feature of B005DNCU20 are: ["Packed with easy meals for busy people, Simple & Delicious features 150+ fail-proof, simple-to-fix recipes and tips that promise mouth-watering meals fast!

Thought 14: Thought 14: None of the item nodes associated with brand_728 seem to match "dunkaroo oreos" based on their descriptions. The descriptions all appear to be about magazines rather than food products. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps "dunkaroo oreos" is not a brand but rather a specific product name. Let me search for it as a complete phrase using RetrieveNode.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode["dunkaroo oreos"]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_758.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I retrieved a different brand node (brand_758) when searching for "dunkaroo oreos" as a complete phrase. Let me check the items associated with this brand to see if any match the query.
Action 15: Action 15: NeighbourCheck[brand_758, item]
