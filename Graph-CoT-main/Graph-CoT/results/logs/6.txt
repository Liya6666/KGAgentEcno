Question: What is the brand of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the brand of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the brand of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary""). This looks like HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the node using this string as it appears in the question.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have retrieved the item node with ID B00005N7NQ. Now I need to find its brand. To do this, I should check the brand neighbors of this item node.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 2: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I have found that the item node B00005N7NQ has a brand neighbor with ID 'brand_0'. Now I need to get the name feature of this brand node to answer the question, as requested to provide the main feature (name) rather than the node ID.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 3: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have found that the brand name for the item is "Reason Magazine". This answers the question about the brand of the item with the incomplete title.
Action 4: Finish[Reason Magazine]
Observation 4: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Bonnier Corporation
