Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item, but the item name appears to be incomplete or corrupted ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary""). This looks like it might be HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the node using this string as a keyword, but it's possible this might not match a standard item title.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have retrieved a node with ID B00005N7NQ using the HTML-like string. Now I need to understand what this node represents and find its format. Since the question asks for the "format" of the item, I should check the node's features to understand what type of content or media format it might be. The item features include title, description, price, img, and category - one of these might indicate the format.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 2: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The title feature itself contains the HTML code "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". This suggests that the item's title might be incomplete or that this is a special case. I should check other features like category and description to understand what format this item represents. The "format" likely refers to the media format (e.g., DVD, CD, digital, etc.) or product type.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 3: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The category indicates this is a magazine subscription in the professional/educational/journal category. However, I still need to determine the specific format. Magazine subscriptions could be in print or digital format. I should check the description feature which might contain details about the format.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 4: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The description provides details about the magazine content but doesn't explicitly mention the format. Since this is categorized as a magazine subscription, I should check if there are any additional features or neighbors that might indicate the format. The price or other features might contain format information. Let me also check if this item has brand information that might clarify the format.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, price]
Observation 5: The price feature of B00005N7NQ are: . 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The price feature appears to be empty or missing. Since the question asks for the "format" of the item and we know it's a magazine subscription, I should check if there are any neighbors or additional information that might indicate whether this is a print or digital format. Let me check the brand of this item, as the brand might provide clues about the format.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 6: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I have the brand node ID 'brand_0'. To get more information about the format, I should check the brand name feature, as it might indicate whether this is a print or digital publication. Additionally, I should check if there are other related items that might give clues about the format.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 7: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The brand name is "Reason Magazine", which confirms this is a magazine subscription. However, I still need to determine the specific format (print, digital, etc.). Since the direct features haven't revealed the format, I should check if there are related items (also_viewed, also_bought, etc.) that might indicate the format. For example, if there are digital edition items or print edition items linked to this one, that could clarify the format.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 8: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I have a list of also_viewed_item neighbors. To understand the format of the original item, I should check the titles or categories of some of these related items to see if they indicate whether this is a print or digital magazine subscription. Let me check the title features of a few of these related items.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00005N7R5, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B00005N7R5 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I notice that another related item (B00005N7R5) also has the same HTML-like title format "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". This pattern suggests that these might be magazine subscription items with incomplete or improperly formatted titles. Since the category indicates these are magazine subscriptions, and the brand is "Reason Magazine", I should check if there are any other features or neighbors that explicitly mention the format. Let me check the category of one of the also_viewed items to see if it provides more specific format information.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00005N7R5, category]
Observation 10: The category feature of B00005N7R5 are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: Both the original item and the related item have identical categories and similar HTML-like titles. This suggests these are magazine subscription items from the same publication. Since the features don't explicitly state the format, and given that these are categorized as magazine subscriptions with the brand "Reason Magazine," I should consider that magazine subscriptions typically come in specific formats. Common formats for magazine subscriptions include print, digital, or combined print+digital. Let me check if there are any bought_together_item neighbors that might indicate the format, as items bought together might include format-specific versions.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, bought_together_item]
Observation 11: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: []. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The bought_together_item neighbors list is empty. Let me check the also_bought_item neighbors to see if they provide any format clues.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 12: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I have a list of also_bought_item neighbors. To determine the format, I should check the titles and categories of some of these items. Since the original item appears to be a magazine subscription, I should look for items that might indicate whether it's a print or digital format. Let me check the title of one of these also_bought items to see if it contains format information.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B01AKS14AQ, title]
Observation 13: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 14: Thought 14: The feature name might be incorrect. Let me try retrieving the title feature for this node again with the correct syntax.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B01AKS14AQ, title]
Observation 14: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 15: Thought 15: The node B01AKS14AQ might not exist or there might be an issue with the node ID. Let me try checking a different also_bought_item neighbor. I'll try B00005N7SD which appeared in both also_viewed and also_bought lists.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00005N7SD, title]
Observation 15: The title feature of B00005N7SD are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary".
Correct answer: Print Magazine
