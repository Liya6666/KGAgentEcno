Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item, but the item name appears to be incomplete or malformed ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary""). This looks like HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the node using this string, but it might not match exactly. Let me try retrieving the node with the given string.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have retrieved a node with ID B00005N7NQ using the HTML-like string. Now I need to understand what "format" means in this context. Since item nodes have features like title, description, price, img, and category, "format" might refer to one of these attributes. Looking at the question more carefully, it mentions "providing node main feature (e.g., names)", so "format" might be referring to the category or possibly the media format if this is a media item. Let me first check the basic features of this item to understand what type of product it is.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 2: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The title feature itself contains the HTML code "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"", which suggests this might be a data extraction issue or the title is actually HTML-formatted. The question is asking for the "format" of the item. In e-commerce contexts, "format" often refers to the physical/digital format of media products (like DVD, Blu-ray, MP3, etc.) or the product category. Let me check the category feature of this item to see if it reveals the format.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 3: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The category shows this is a magazine subscription, which is a specific format. However, "format" might refer to the specific type of magazine subscription (digital vs. print) or the subscription duration. Let me check the description feature to get more details about the format.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 4: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The description confirms this is a magazine subscription called "REASON" focused on economic and social issues. However, the question specifically asks for the "format" of the item. For magazine subscriptions, the format typically refers to whether it's a print or digital subscription, or possibly the subscription duration. Since the category mentions "Magazine Subscriptions" but doesn't specify the format type, I should check if there are any other features that might indicate the format. Let me also check if there are any brand or other relationships that might provide format information.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, price]
Observation 5: The price feature of B00005N7NQ are: . 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The price feature returned empty, which might indicate missing data. Since "format" is still ambiguous, I should check if this item has any brand relationships that might provide format information. For magazine subscriptions, the format might be implied by the brand or category. Let me check the brand of this item.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 6: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I have the brand node ID 'brand_0'. Let me check the brand name to see if it provides any information about the format.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 7: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The brand name "Reason Magazine" confirms this is a magazine subscription. However, the question is specifically asking for the "format" of the item. In the context of magazine subscriptions, "format" typically refers to whether it's a print or digital subscription. Since the features I've checked so far (title, category, description, brand) don't explicitly specify the format, I should consider that "format" might be referring to the category itself. The category includes "Magazine Subscriptions" which is a format type. Alternatively, I should check if there are any other item relationships that might indicate format information.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 8: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: Looking at the also_viewed_item neighbors, I see many similar item IDs. The format information might be consistent across similar items. Let me check one of these related items to see if their features reveal the format more clearly. I'll check the category of one of these related items.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, category]
Observation 9: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 10: Thought 10: The node B000UHI2LW might not exist or I need to check a different feature. Let me try checking the title of one of the related items to understand what type of products these are.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 10: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 11: Thought 11: The node B000UHI2LW might not be accessible or might be a different type of node. Let me try checking a different related item from the list. I'll try B002PXW18E.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B002PXW18E, title]
Observation 11: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 12: Thought 12: It seems the also_viewed_item neighbors might not be accessible with the standard item features, or these IDs might represent different types of nodes. Let me reconsider the problem. The question is asking for the "format" of the item, and based on the category information I already have, this is clearly a magazine subscription. In e-commerce contexts, "Magazine Subscriptions" is itself a format category. The question also specifies to answer using "node main feature (e.g., names)", so the category would be appropriate. Let me verify if there are any other features that might explicitly mention "format".
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, img]
Observation 12: The img feature of B00005N7NQ are: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Iph04Jy3L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The image URL doesn't provide format information. Based on all the information gathered, the item is clearly a magazine subscription. The category feature shows "Magazine Subscriptions" as the primary category, which represents the format of this item. Since the question asks for the format and specifies to answer using node main features, I should provide the category information.
Action 13: Thought 13: Based on my investigation, the item with the HTML-like title appears to be a magazine subscription. The category feature explicitly lists "Magazine Subscriptions" as the primary category, which represents the format of this item. Since the question asks for the format and specifies to answer using node main features, I should provide the category information.
Observation 13: 
Thought 14: Action 13: Finish[Magazine Subscriptions]
Action 14: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item with an unusual title that appears to be HTML code ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary""). I need to first retrieve the node using this string.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item with an unusual title that appears to be HTML code ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary""). I need to first retrieve the node using this string.
Action 15: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item with an unusual title that appears to be HTML code ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary""). I need to first retrieve the node using this string.
Observation 15:
