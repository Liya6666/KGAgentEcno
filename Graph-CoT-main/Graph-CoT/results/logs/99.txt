Question: Which object is co-viewed more than 4 times with the object Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which object is co-viewed more than 4 times with the object Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items that are co-viewed (also_viewed_item) with the item "Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag" more than 4 times. First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0000ARXXS.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find all the also_viewed_item neighbors of this node. Then I need to check how many times each of those items is co-viewed with our target item. Since the question asks for items co-viewed more than 4 times, I need to find the count of also_viewed_item connections for each neighbor.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B0000ARXXS, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B0000ARXXS are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the item "Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag" has no also_viewed_item neighbors. This suggests that either the item doesn't exist in the graph or it has no recorded co-viewed items. However, since we were able to retrieve the node ID, the item exists. I should verify if this is indeed the correct node by checking its features to ensure we have the right item.
Action 3: NodeFeature[B0000ARXXS, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B0000ARXXS are: Everyday Food. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieved node has the title "Everyday Food", which doesn't match the query "Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag". This suggests that the initial retrieval might have been incorrect. I need to try retrieving the node again with a more specific or accurate query.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[Whole Grain Buckwheat 50 Pound Bag]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0000ARXXS.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval is still returning the same node ID (B0000ARXXS) with title "Everyday Food", which doesn't match our query. This suggests that either the item doesn't exist in the graph under that exact name, or I need to try a different approach. Let me try to search for "Buckwheat" to see if I can find the correct item.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Buckwheat]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0009GIZ0W.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I retrieved a node with ID B0009GIZ0W for "Buckwheat". Let me check its title to see if it matches our target item "Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag".
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B0009GIZ0W, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B0009GIZ0W are: Herb Companion. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieved node for "Buckwheat" has title "Herb Companion", which doesn't match our target item. I need to try a more specific search. Let me try searching for "Whole Grain Buckwheat" to see if I can find the correct item.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Whole Grain Buckwheat]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0000ARXXS.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm still getting the same node ID (B0000ARXXS) with title "Everyday Food" when searching for "Whole Grain Buckwheat". This suggests that the item "Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag" might not exist in the graph under that exact name. Let me try a different approach - I'll search for "50 Pound Bag" to see if I can find bulk food items that might include our target.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[50 Pound Bag]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0000ARXXS.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I keep getting the same node ID (B0000ARXXS) regardless of what variation I search for, and its title is "Everyday Food" which doesn't match our target item. This suggests that either the item doesn't exist in the graph, or there might be an issue with the retrieval function. Since the question specifically mentions "Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag", I should assume it exists and try to work with what I have. Let me check the also_viewed_item neighbors of this node again, even though the title doesn't match, to see if there are any co-viewed items.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[B0000ARXXS, also_viewed_item]
Observation 9: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B0000ARXXS are: []. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The observation confirms that node B0000ARXXS has no also_viewed_item neighbors. Since this node doesn't match our target item's title and has no co-viewed items, I need to try a different approach. Let me search for "Buckwheat" with more specific terms or try to find items that might be related to bulk grains. Perhaps the item exists under a slightly different name.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Whole Grain Buckwheat 50 Pound]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0000ARXXS.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm consistently getting the same node ID (B0000ARXXS) with title "Everyday Food" when searching for variations of "Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag". This suggests that either:
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0000ARXXS.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm consistently retrieving the same node ID (B0000ARXXS) with title "Everyday Food" when searching for "Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag". This suggests that either:
Action 12: Thought 12: I'm consistently retrieving the same node ID (B0000ARXXS) with title "Everyday Food" when searching for "Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag". This suggests that either the item doesn't exist in the graph under that exact name, or there's a mismatch in the retrieval system. Since I can't find the correct item, I should try a different approach. Let me search for items that might be related to buckwheat or bulk grains to see if I can find the correct item.
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm consistently retrieving the same node ID (B0000ARXXS) with title "Everyday Food" when searching for "Whole Grain Buckwheat - 50 Pound Bag". This suggests that either the item doesn't exist in the graph under that exact name, or there's a mismatch in the retrieval system. Since I can't find the correct item, I should try a different approach. Let me search for items that might be related to buckwheat or bulk grains to see if I can find the correct item.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Buckwheat 50 Pound]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0009GIZ0W.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I retrieved node B0009GIZ0W for "Buckwheat 50 Pound". Let me check its title to see if it matches our target item.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B0009GIZ0W, title]
Observation 14: The title feature of B0009GIZ0W are: Herb Companion. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm still not getting the correct item. Let me try a different approach. Since the retrieval function might not be finding the exact match, I should look for items with "buckwheat" in their title by checking the category or description features of nodes that might be related. However, the available functions don't allow searching by category or description directly. I need to find another way. Perhaps I can search for "50 Pound" to find bulk items and then check if any of them are buckwheat.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[50 Pound]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_57.
Correct answer: Arrowhead Mills Organic Buckwheat Flour, 32 Ounce, Great River Organic Milling, Organic Specialty Buckwheat Flour, 25-Pound Package, Great River Organic Milling Organic Specialty Flour Buckwheat, 50-Pounds
