Question: What count of buy-after-viewing items does AI Racer Starter Set have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What count of buy-after-viewing items does AI Racer Starter Set have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the count of buy-after-viewing items for the item "AI Racer Starter Set". First, I need to find the node for this item in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[AI Racer Starter Set]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00K05O272.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the node ID for the item. The question asks for the count of buy-after-viewing items. I need to find how many "buy_after_viewing_item" neighbors this node has. I should use NodeDegree to get the count.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00K05O272, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 2: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbor node degree of B00K05O272 are: 0. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the node has 0 buy_after_viewing_item neighbors. However, the question asks for the count, and the answer should be 0. But let me double-check if there might be any neighbors by using NeighbourCheck to see if there are any buy_after_viewing_item neighbors listed.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00K05O272, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 3: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00K05O272 are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The NeighbourCheck confirms that there are no buy_after_viewing_item neighbors for this item. Therefore, the count is 0. Since the question asks for the count, I can provide the answer directly.
Action 4: Finish[0]
Observation 4: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 0
