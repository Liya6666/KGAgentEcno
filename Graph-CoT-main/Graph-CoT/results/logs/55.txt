Question: How many also-bought items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many also-bought items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the number of also-bought items for a specific item, but the item name appears to be incomplete or malformed: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". This looks like an HTML fragment rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the correct item node, but the given string might not match any node's title exactly. I should try to retrieve the node with the provided string, but if that fails, I may need to interpret or correct the item name.
Action 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the number of also-bought items for a specific item, but the item name appears to be incomplete or malformed: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". This looks like an HTML fragment rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the correct item node, but the given string might not match any node's title exactly. I should try to retrieve the node with the provided string, but if that fails, I may need to interpret or correct the item name.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: The Observation 1 appears to be empty or an error, which suggests that the provided string "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"" does not match any item node's title. I need to reconsider the approach. Perhaps the item name is incomplete, and I should look for items that might contain part of this string or have a similar pattern. Alternatively, maybe the question contains a placeholder or error, and I need to interpret the intended item. Let me try retrieving the node with a more reasonable keyword, such as by extracting potential meaningful words from the string, though it seems mostly HTML attributes. The string "a-size-medium a-color-secondary" might be CSS classes, but not a product title. I should attempt to retrieve with the full string as given, but if it fails, I might need to assume it's a specific item node ID or seek clarification. However, since the task is to answer based on the graph, I'll try the retrieve function with the given string first.
Action 2: Action 2: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval was successful, and I now have the node ID B00005N7NQ for the item. The question asks for the number of also-bought items for this item. I need to calculate the node's degree for the "also_bought_item" neighbor type. However, the question specifies to answer by providing node main features (e.g., names) rather than node IDs, which suggests I should list the names of the also-bought items, not just the count. But the question says "How many also-bought items", which implies a count, yet the instruction says to provide names. This is ambiguous. I should interpret it as needing to list the also-bought items by their names (main features) and then count them. First, I'll find the also-bought item neighbors, then retrieve their titles.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have retrieved the list of also_bought_item neighbor IDs for the item. The question asks for the number of also-bought items, but specifies to provide node main features (names) rather than node IDs. This suggests I need to get the titles of these items and then count them. Since there are many neighbors (appears to be 38 based on the list), I should retrieve the title feature for each of these item nodes to get their names. However, listing all 38 titles might be verbose. The core question is "how many", so the count is primary, but I need to provide the names as per the instruction. I'll retrieve the titles for all these items.
Action 4: Action 4: I need to get the titles for all the also_bought_item neighbors. Since there are 38 items, I'll retrieve their titles one by one using NodeFeature.
Observation 4: 
Thought 5: Thought 5: I need to retrieve the titles for all the also_bought_item neighbors. Since there are 38 items, I should retrieve their titles systematically. I'll start by getting the title for the first few items to confirm the approach, but for the final answer, I'll need to get all titles and count them.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B01MCU84LB, title]
Observation 5: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The error suggests that "title" might not be the correct feature name for item nodes. According to the graph definition, item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. So "title" should be correct. Perhaps the node ID B01MCU84LB doesn't exist or there's an issue. Let me try retrieving the node first to confirm it exists, then get its title feature.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[B01MCU84LB]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieval returned "brand_411" for the ID B01MCU84LB, which suggests that B01MCU84LB might be a brand node ID rather than an item node ID. However, the NeighbourCheck returned B01MCU84LB as an also_bought_item neighbor, which should be an item node. This is confusing. Let me check the node type by trying to get its features. For brand nodes, the main feature is "name", not "title". Let me try NodeFeature with "name" for this node.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B01MCU84LB, name]
Observation 7: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm encountering issues with retrieving features for the neighbor nodes. The problem might be that some of the IDs returned by NeighbourCheck are not valid item nodes, or there's a mismatch in node types. Let me first verify the type of the original item node and then check one of the neighbor nodes more carefully. I should also confirm the correct feature names for item nodes.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 9: Thought 9: Now I understand - the item node B00005N7NQ has a title feature that matches the HTML fragment from the question. This confirms we have the correct node. The title appears to be malformed HTML, but it's what's stored in the graph. Now I need to handle the also_bought_item neighbors. The issue earlier was that some neighbor IDs might be brand nodes or invalid. Let me check the node type of one of the neighbors by trying to retrieve it and check its features.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[B01MCU84LB]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 10: Thought 10: The retrieval confirms that B01MCU84LB is a brand node (brand_411), not an item node. This suggests that the NeighbourCheck function returned a mix of item and brand nodes for the "also_bought_item" relationship, which contradicts the graph definition where "also_bought_item" should link to other item nodes. This might be an error in the graph data or my understanding. Let me check the graph definition again - item nodes are linked to "also_bought_item" nodes, which should be other item nodes. Perhaps some of these IDs are actually item nodes but are being misinterpreted. Let me try to get the title feature for one of the other neighbor IDs that looks more like a standard product ID.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00005NIOH, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B00005NIOH are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 11: Thought 11: I see a pattern emerging - multiple nodes seem to have the same HTML fragment as their title feature. This suggests that the graph data might have inconsistencies or that these are placeholder values. For the purpose of answering the question about "how many also-bought items", I should count the number of unique neighbor IDs returned by the NeighbourCheck function, regardless of their actual titles. The question asks to provide node main features (names) rather than node IDs, but given that the titles are all the same HTML fragment, listing them wouldn't be meaningful. I should proceed with counting the number of also_bought_item neighbors directly.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 11: The also_bought_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 38. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The NodeDegree function confirms there are 38 also_bought_item neighbors for this item. The question asks for the number of also-bought items but specifies to answer by providing node main features (names) rather than node IDs. However, based on my investigation, the titles of these items appear to be the same HTML fragment "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"", which is not meaningful. Since the core question is about the count, and the instruction about providing names seems impractical in this case, I should provide the count as the answer, noting the issue with the titles.
Action 12: Action 12: Finish[38]
Observation 12: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 71
