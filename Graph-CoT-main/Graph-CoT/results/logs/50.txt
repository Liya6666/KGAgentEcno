Question: How many also-bought items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many also-bought items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the number of also-bought items for a specific item. However, the item name appears to be incomplete or corrupted - it shows HTML/CSS classes instead of a proper item title. I need to first identify the correct item node. The HTML snippet suggests this might be related to an Amazon-style product display. I should try to retrieve the node using the provided text as a keyword.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have retrieved the node ID B00005N7NQ. Now I need to verify what this item actually is by checking its title feature, since the question mentioned providing node main features rather than IDs.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 2: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The title feature appears to contain HTML/CSS classes rather than a proper product name. This seems unusual. I should check if this is indeed the correct item node by examining other features like description or category to better understand what this item represents.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 3: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The description indicates this is likely a magazine subscription called "REASON" focused on economic and social issues. Now I need to answer the original question about how many also-bought items this item has. I should use the NodeDegree function to count the also_bought_item neighbors.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 4: The also_bought_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 38. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: I have determined that the item has 38 also-bought items. However, the question specifically asks to provide node main features (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. I need to retrieve the actual titles/names of these also-bought items. I should use the NeighbourCheck function to get the list of also_bought_item neighbors, and then retrieve their title features.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 5: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I now have the list of also-bought item node IDs. Since the question asks to provide node main features (names/titles) rather than node IDs, I need to retrieve the title features for each of these neighbor nodes. However, there are 38 items, which would be too many to list individually in a response. The question is asking "how many" also-bought items, but with the additional requirement to provide names rather than IDs. This seems contradictory - typically "how many" questions just require a number, but the instruction specifies using main features. I should clarify what exactly is being asked. Perhaps I need to provide the count and then list some representative titles.
Action 6: Thought 6: The question is asking "how many" also-bought items, but with the specific instruction to "answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs." This suggests I should provide the count along with the actual product names/titles of the also-bought items. Since there are 38 items, listing all their titles might be excessive, but I should retrieve at least a few representative titles to demonstrate the response format. Let me retrieve the title features for the first few neighbor nodes to provide examples.
Observation 6: 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I need to retrieve the title features for the also-bought items to provide their names as requested. Since there are 38 items, I'll retrieve titles for the first few to provide examples while also giving the total count.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B01MCU84LB, title]
Observation 7: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I encountered an error when trying to retrieve the title feature for node B01MCU84LB. This suggests that either the node ID is incorrect or the feature name should be different. Let me try with the correct feature name "title" (which should be correct based on the graph definition) or check if this node exists properly.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[B01MCU84LB]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I see the issue - when I retrieved the neighbor node B01MCU84LB, it appears to be a brand node (brand_411) rather than an item node. This suggests that the also_bought_item relationship might include both item and brand nodes, or there might be an inconsistency in the graph. Let me check what type of node B01MCU84LB actually is by examining its features.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[brand_411, name]
Observation 9: The name feature of brand_411 are: 1105 Media. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I see that one of the "also_bought_item" neighbors is actually a brand node (1105 Media) rather than an item node. This suggests there might be inconsistencies in the graph data. Let me check a few more neighbor nodes to understand the pattern and then provide an accurate response. I'll check the next few neighbors to see if they are items or brands.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B01AKS14AQ, title]
Observation 10: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm encountering the same issue with multiple neighbor nodes - they appear to be brand nodes rather than item nodes when I try to retrieve them. Let me systematically check what types of nodes are in the also_bought_item neighbors list by retrieving a few more and checking their features.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[B01AKS14AQ]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm noticing a pattern - multiple neighbor IDs are mapping to the same brand node (brand_411). This suggests there might be an issue with the graph data or my understanding. Let me check a few more neighbor IDs to see if they are valid item nodes or if they all map to brand nodes.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[B001THPA26]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_381.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm seeing a consistent pattern where the "also_bought_item" neighbor IDs are actually resolving to brand nodes rather than item nodes. This suggests there might be an issue with the graph data or my interpretation. Let me check a few more neighbors to confirm this pattern, and then check what the actual item nodes connected via also_bought_item relationship should be.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[B002CT515Q]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently finding that the "also_bought_item" neighbor IDs are resolving to brand nodes rather than item nodes. This suggests there might be an issue with the graph data or my approach. Let me try a different strategy - instead of retrieving each neighbor individually, let me check what type of neighbors are actually connected via the also_bought_item relationship by examining the original item node's connections more carefully.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 14: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm seeing that the item is categorized as a magazine subscription in economics. The issue with the "also_bought_item" neighbors resolving to brand nodes suggests there might be a data inconsistency in the graph. However, I have the count of 38 from Observation 4. Since the question asks for "how many" but also specifies to provide node main features rather than IDs, and given the data inconsistencies I've encountered, I should provide the count along with the information I can reliably retrieve. Let me try to get the actual item titles by checking if there are valid item nodes connected through this relationship.
Action 15: Thought 15: I've encountered inconsistencies where the "also_bought_item" neighbor IDs appear to resolve to brand nodes rather than item nodes. However, I have the count of 38 from Observation 4. Since the question asks "how many" but specifies to provide node main features rather than IDs, I should try to find valid item nodes connected through this relationship. Let me check if there are any actual item nodes connected via also_bought_item by examining the neighbor types more carefully.
Observation 15:
Correct answer: 3
