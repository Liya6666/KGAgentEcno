Question: What is the substitutive item given this query: leather iphone xs max case?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the substitutive item given this query: leather iphone xs max case? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a substitutive item for "leather iphone xs max case". This likely means I need to find an item node that matches this description, then look for related items that could serve as substitutes - probably through connections like also_viewed_item, also_bought_item, or bought_together_item. First, I need to find the relevant item node.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[leather iphone xs max case]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00FCJIQQO.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID for the leather iPhone XS Max case, I need to find substitutive items. Substitutes are typically items that are similar or related - likely connected through also_viewed_item, also_bought_item, or bought_together_item relationships. I should first check what related items exist for this node.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00FCJIQQO, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00FCJIQQO are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The also_viewed_item list is empty. I should try other relationship types that might contain substitutive items, such as also_bought_item or bought_together_item.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00FCJIQQO, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00FCJIQQO are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The also_bought_item list is also empty. I should try the bought_together_item relationship type, which might contain items that are commonly purchased together and could serve as substitutes.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B00FCJIQQO, bought_together_item]
Observation 4: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00FCJIQQO are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: All the typical relationship types for finding substitutive items (also_viewed_item, also_bought_item, bought_together_item) returned empty lists. I should check if there are any other relationships available or consider checking the brand relationship, as items from the same brand might serve as substitutes. Let me first check what brand this item belongs to, then look for other items from the same brand.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00FCJIQQO, brand]
Observation 5: The brand neighbors of B00FCJIQQO are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The brand neighbors list is also empty. This suggests that the node B00FCJIQQO might not have the expected relationships. I should verify that this is indeed the correct node by checking its features, particularly the title, to ensure it matches "leather iphone xs max case". If it does, then I might need to consider alternative approaches, such as searching for other items with similar keywords or categories.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00FCJIQQO, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00FCJIQQO are: Safari Garden Wireless Earbuds and built in Mic for Hands Free Calling. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The title "Safari Garden Wireless Earbuds and built in Mic for Hands Free Calling" does not match "leather iphone xs max case" at all. It seems I retrieved the wrong node. I need to search more carefully for the correct item node. Let me try a more specific search with the exact query.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[leather iphone xs max case]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00FCJIQQO.
Thought 8: Thought 8: The RetrieveNode function is consistently returning the same node ID (B00FCJIQQO) which has a title about wireless earbuds, not a leather iPhone case. This suggests the graph might not contain an exact match for "leather iphone xs max case". I need to try a different approach - perhaps searching with partial keywords or checking if there are any iPhone case items in the graph that might be relevant. Let me try searching with just "iphone xs max case" to see if I can find related items.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[iphone xs max case]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007GAMH.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I got a different node ID (B00007GAMH) when searching for "iphone xs max case". Let me check the title of this node to see if it's relevant to the query.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00007GAMH, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B00007GAMH are: Moto Kids. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The title "Moto Kids" doesn't seem related to iPhone cases either. It appears the graph might not have exact matches for these search terms. I should try a more general approach - searching for "leather case" or "iphone case" to find potentially relevant items, then check if any are specifically for iPhone XS Max.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[leather case]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00FCJIQQO.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm consistently getting the same irrelevant node (B00FCJIQQO) when searching for various keywords. This suggests the graph might not contain exact matches for these search terms, or the RetrieveNode function might be limited in its matching capabilities. I should try a different strategy - perhaps I need to search for items in the "case" category or look for items with "iphone" in their title. Let me try searching for "case" to see if I can find any case-related items.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[case]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_527.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I retrieved a brand node (brand_527) when searching for "case". This is not what I want - I need item nodes. Let me check what this brand is and see if it has any items that might be relevant to iPhone cases.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[brand_527, name]
Observation 12: The name feature of brand_527 are: Law Centre. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: "Law Centre" doesn't seem related to iPhone cases. I need to find a better way to locate relevant items. Since direct keyword searches aren't yielding appropriate results, I should try to find items that might be iPhone cases by searching for "iphone" or checking category information. Let me try searching for "iphone" to see if I can find any iPhone-related items.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[iphone]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007GAMH.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently getting the same limited set of nodes (B00FCJIQQO and B00007GAMH) regardless of the search terms, which suggests the graph might have limited content or the RetrieveNode function has specific limitations. Since I need to find a substitutive item for "leather iphone xs max case", I should work with what's available. Let me check the features of these nodes more thoroughly to see if any could potentially serve as substitutes. I'll start by checking the category of B00007GAMH to see if it's at all related to phone cases.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00007GAMH, category]
Observation 14: The category feature of B00007GAMH are: []. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The category is empty for B00007GAMH. Let me check the category of the other node B00FCJIQQO to see if it might be relevant to phone accessories or cases.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00FCJIQQO, category]
Observation 15: The category feature of B00FCJIQQO are: [].
