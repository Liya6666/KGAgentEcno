Question: How many items are in brand Amos Hobby Publishing?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items are in brand Amos Hobby Publishing? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the number of items associated with a specific brand (Amos Hobby Publishing). First, I need to find the brand node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Amos Hobby Publishing]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_85.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node ID, I need to find how many items are linked to this brand. Since brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, I should check the number of item neighbors for this brand node.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[brand_85, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbor node degree of brand_85 are: 4. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The question asks for the number of items in brand Amos Hobby Publishing, and I've found that there are 4 items. However, the instruction says to "answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs." This suggests I should list the names/titles of these items, not just the count. I need to retrieve the actual item nodes linked to this brand and then get their titles.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_85, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_85 are: ['B00005QDWI', 'B005PRB91C', 'B005PRB8WC', 'B00WVGPR18']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now I have the IDs of the 4 item nodes linked to brand_85. To answer the question properly, I need to get the main feature (title) of each item node, as requested. I should retrieve the title for each item ID.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005QDWI, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00005QDWI are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The observation seems to contain HTML code rather than the actual title. This might be an issue with the data format. Let me try retrieving the title feature for the other item nodes to see if I can get proper titles.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B005PRB91C, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B005PRB91C are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm getting HTML code instead of clean titles for the item nodes. This suggests that the title feature might contain HTML formatting. I should try to extract the actual text content from these HTML spans. However, since I can only use the provided functions, I might need to look for alternative features or check if there's a way to get the clean title. Let me try the "description" feature or see if there's another way to get the item names.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00005QDWI, description]
Observation 6: The description feature of B00005QDWI are: ['The Coin World Weekly News Resource is the most respected print weekly news coin publication in the market, having served the numismatics community since 1960. Coin World Weekly subscribers also get the Coin World Monthly Magazine once per month.', '', '']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The description doesn't give me the item title either. Let me try checking the "category" feature or see if there's another way to get the item names. Since the instruction specifically asks for "node main feature (e.g., names)", and items have "title" as their main feature, I should try to extract the actual text content from the HTML. However, since I can only use the provided functions, I'll try to work with what I have. Let me check all the item nodes to see if any have proper titles.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B005PRB8WC, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B005PRB8WC are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm consistently getting HTML code instead of clean titles for these item nodes. Let me try the last item node to see if it's the same pattern.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00WVGPR18, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B00WVGPR18 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm consistently getting HTML code instead of clean titles for all item nodes. Since the instruction asks to "answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs," but the title features contain HTML formatting, I need to find an alternative way to get the item names. Let me check if there's another feature that might contain the actual item name, or if I can extract the text content from the HTML. Since I can only use the provided functions, I should check if the "description" or "category" features might contain the item names.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00005QDWI, category]
Observation 9: The category feature of B00005QDWI are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional &amp; Educational Journals', 'Professional &amp; Trade', 'Arts', 'Crafts &amp; Collectibles']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The category feature doesn't give me the item name either. Since the instruction specifically asks for "node main feature (e.g., names)" and I'm unable to get clean titles from the title feature due to HTML formatting, I should try to extract the actual text content from the HTML. Looking at the HTML pattern, it seems like the actual title text might be contained within these span tags. However, since I can only use the provided functions and cannot parse HTML, I need to find an alternative approach. Let me check if there's another way to get the item names. Perhaps I should try to retrieve the brand's name feature to confirm I have the right brand, and then simply report the count since the item titles are not accessible in clean format.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[brand_85, name]
Observation 10: The name feature of brand_85 are: Amos Hobby Publishing. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: I've confirmed that brand_85 is indeed "Amos Hobby Publishing". Since I cannot extract clean item titles from the HTML-formatted title features, and the instruction specifically asks to provide node main features (names) rather than node IDs, I need to find an alternative approach. Let me check if there's any other feature that might contain the actual item names. Perhaps I should try to see if the description contains the item name at the beginning.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00005QDWI, description]
Observation 11: The description feature of B00005QDWI are: ['The Coin World Weekly News Resource is the most respected print weekly news coin publication in the market, having served the numismatics community since 1960. Coin World Weekly subscribers also get the Coin World Monthly Magazine once per month.', '', '']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The description doesn't contain the item title either. Since I cannot extract clean item names from the available features due to HTML formatting in the title field, and the instruction requires providing "node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs," I need to reconsider the question. The question asks "How many items are in brand Amos Hobby Publishing?" which primarily requires a count, but with the additional instruction to provide names. Since I cannot obtain clean names, I should provide the count along with an explanation that the item titles are not accessible in clean format. Let me check if there's any other way to get the item names before concluding.
Action 12: Thought 12: Since I cannot extract clean item names from the HTML-formatted title features, and the question asks for both the count and the item names (as per the instruction to provide node main features), I should try one more approach. Let me check if the "img" feature might contain alt text with the item name, or if there's any other way to get the actual item titles.
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I've been unable to extract clean item names from the HTML-formatted title features. Let me try checking the "img" feature to see if it contains alt text with the item names, as this might be another potential source for the item titles.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00005QDWI, img]
Observation 13: The img feature of B00005QDWI are: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IV08oP0SL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The img feature only contains the image URL, not the item name. I've exhausted the available features for getting clean item names. The title features contain HTML formatting that I cannot parse with the available functions. Since the instruction requires providing "node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs," but I cannot extract clean names from the HTML-formatted titles, I should provide the count and explain the limitation. The question primarily asks for "how many items," so I can answer with the count and note that the item titles are embedded in HTML format.
Action 14: Thought 15: I have determined that there are 4 items associated with brand Amos Hobby Publishing (brand_85). However, I cannot extract clean item names from the HTML-formatted title features using the available functions. Since the instruction requires providing node main features (names) rather than node IDs, but the title data is not accessible in clean format, I will provide the count and note this limitation.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: Based on my analysis, I have found that brand Amos Hobby Publishing (brand_85) has 4 items associated with it. However, when attempting to retrieve the item names (titles) as requested, I discovered that the title features contain HTML formatting (<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">) rather than clean text. I attempted to extract the actual item names from other features (description, category, img) but was unsuccessful. Since the instruction requires providing node main features (names) rather than node IDs, but the title data is not accessible in clean format with the available functions, I will provide the count and note this limitation.
Action 15: Finish[There are 4 items in brand Amos Hobby Publishing. However, the item titles are embedded in HTML formatting (<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">) and cannot be extracted as clean text using the available functions. The item IDs are: B00005QDWI, B005PRB91C, B005PRB8WC, B00WVGPR18.]
Observation 15: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 4
