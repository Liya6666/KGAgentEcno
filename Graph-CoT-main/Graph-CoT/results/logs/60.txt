Question: Can you tell me how many items were also purchased with AyeGear Men's 23 Pocket Travel Vest with Dual iPad Pockets?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you tell me how many items were also purchased with AyeGear Men's 23 Pocket Travel Vest with Dual iPad Pockets? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items that were also purchased with "AyeGear Men's 23 Pocket Travel Vest with Dual iPad Pockets". This likely refers to the "bought_together_item" relationship. First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[AyeGear Men's 23 Pocket Travel Vest with Dual iPad Pockets]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_923.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned a brand node ID (brand_923) instead of an item node ID. This suggests that the item title might be similar to a brand name, or there might be a confusion in the graph. Let me try to retrieve the item node more specifically by adding "item" context or checking if there's an item with this title.
Action 2: Thought 2: The observation returned a brand node ID, but the question is about an item. This might be because the item title is similar to a brand name or there was a retrieval error. I should try to retrieve the item node by using a more precise keyword or by considering that the item might be stored under a slightly different title. Alternatively, I can check if the brand node has linked items that might include this vest.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: Since the initial retrieval returned a brand node instead of an item node, I should try to retrieve the item node with a more specific approach. Perhaps the full title wasn't matched exactly. Let me try to retrieve using a partial keyword or check if there are items linked to this brand that might be the vest.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[AyeGear Men's 23 Pocket Travel Vest]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BYTOWA.
Thought 4: Thought 4: Great! Now I have the correct item node ID (B000BYTOWA). The question is asking about items that were "also purchased with" this vest. Based on the graph definition, this likely refers to the "bought_together_item" relationship. I need to find how many bought_together_item neighbors this item has, and then get their names (titles) rather than just IDs.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeDegree[B000BYTOWA, bought_together_item]
Observation 4: The bought_together_item neighbor node degree of B000BYTOWA are: 0. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The observation shows that the item has 0 bought_together_item neighbors. However, the question asks about items "also purchased with" this vest, which might refer to other relationship types like "also_bought_item". Let me check the also_bought_item neighbors instead.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeDegree[B000BYTOWA, also_bought_item]
Observation 5: The also_bought_item neighbor node degree of B000BYTOWA are: 0. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: Both bought_together_item and also_bought_item returned 0 neighbors. However, the question specifically mentions "also purchased with," which might be referring to a different relationship. Let me check what other purchase-related relationships exist for this item. I should examine all the neighbors of this item node to see what relationships are available.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B000BYTOWA, all]
Observation 6: The node or neighbor type does not exist in the graph. This might because your given neighbor type is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I need to check what specific neighbor types are available for this item node. Since "all" is not a valid neighbor type, I should check individual relationship types one by one. The graph definition mentions several relationship types: brand, also_viewed_item, buy_after_viewing_item, also_bought_item, and bought_together_item. Let me check each of these to see which ones have neighbors.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeDegree[B000BYTOWA, brand]
Observation 7: The brand neighbor node degree of B000BYTOWA are: 0. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The brand degree is 0, which is unusual. Let me check other relationship types to see if there are any neighbors. I'll check also_viewed_item and buy_after_viewing_item.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeDegree[B000BYTOWA, also_viewed_item]
Observation 8: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B000BYTOWA are: 0. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: All relationship types are returning 0 neighbors, which seems unusual. Let me verify that I have the correct item node by checking its features to ensure it matches the item in question.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B000BYTOWA, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B000BYTOWA are: Backpacking Light. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The title "Backpacking Light" doesn't match the item "AyeGear Men's 23 Pocket Travel Vest with Dual iPad Pockets". This means I have the wrong node. I need to find the correct item node for the vest. Let me try a different retrieval approach.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Travel Vest with Dual iPad Pockets]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_923.
Thought 11: Thought 11: The retrieval is still returning brand_923 instead of the item node. This suggests that the item title might not be stored exactly as given in the question. Let me try to retrieve the brand node first and then check what items are linked to it, as the vest might be one of them.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[brand_923, name]
Observation 11: The name feature of brand_923 are: Pocket Outdoor Media. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The brand name "Pocket Outdoor Media" doesn't match "AyeGear", so this is not the correct brand. I need to find the correct item node for "AyeGear Men's 23 Pocket Travel Vest with Dual iPad Pockets". Let me try a different keyword approach, perhaps using "AyeGear" as the brand and then finding the vest item.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[AyeGear]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_317.
Thought 13: Thought 13: Now I have a brand node for AyeGear (brand_317). I should check what items are linked to this brand to find the specific travel vest.
Action 13: Action 13: NeighbourCheck[brand_317, item]
Observation 13: The item neighbors of brand_317 are: ['B00006KSPE']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I found one item linked to the AyeGear brand (B00006KSPE). Let me check its title to see if it matches the travel vest in question.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00006KSPE, title]
Observation 14: The title feature of B00006KSPE are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The title feature returned HTML code instead of a readable title. This suggests there might be an issue with the data. Let me try to retrieve the item node using a more specific approach or check if there are other items linked to the AyeGear brand. Alternatively, I should try to retrieve the item with the exact title from the question.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[AyeGear Men's 23 Pocket Travel Vest with Dual iPad Pockets item]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_923.
Correct answer: 1
