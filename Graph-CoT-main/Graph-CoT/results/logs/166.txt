Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['Breaking Free: How to Quit Your Job and Start Your Own Business', 'Gambler Evolution Bait Knife', 'Solar BBQ Light', "Jack Daniel's 01749 Wood BBQ Smoking Chips", 'MUSTAD Stainless Steel Bait Knife', 'Weber 6494 12-Inch 3-Sided Grill Brush']?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['Breaking Free: How to Quit Your Job and Start Your Own Business', 'Gambler Evolution Bait Knife', 'Solar BBQ Light', "Jack Daniel's 01749 Wood BBQ Smoking Chips", 'MUSTAD Stainless Steel Bait Knife', 'Weber 6494 12-Inch 3-Sided Grill Brush']? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a recommendation based on a user's purchase/viewing history. I need to analyze the items in the history list and find patterns or connections between them to determine what might be a relevant next recommendation. First, I should retrieve the nodes for each item in the history to understand their features and relationships.
