Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item with a specific title containing HTML-like text: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". First, I need to find the item node with this title in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00005N7NQ), I need to understand what the question means by "format." Since item nodes have features like title, description, price, img, and category, "format" might refer to one of these. However, the question specifies to answer using the node's main feature (e.g., names), so I should check the item's category or another relevant feature. Let me first retrieve the node's features to see what information is available.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 2: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The category information shows this is a magazine/journal subscription, but the question specifically asks about "format." In the context of items like this, "format" might refer to whether it's a physical or digital product, or perhaps the media type. Since the category suggests it's a subscription, I should check the description or title for more details about the format. Let me check the description feature.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 3: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The description provides content details but doesn't explicitly mention the format. Since this is categorized as a magazine subscription, and the question asks for "format," I should check if there's any indication in the title or other features about whether this is a print or digital format. Let me check the title feature to see if it contains format information.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature appears to be the same HTML-like text from the question. This suggests that the "format" might actually be referring to the item's category or type. Since the category indicates this is a magazine/journal subscription, and the question asks for the format, I should provide the category information as the format. The main categories are "Magazine Subscriptions" and "Professional & Educational Journals," which describe the format of this item.
Action 5: Action 5: Finish[Magazine Subscriptions, Professional & Educational Journals]
Observation 5: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Print Magazine
