Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item Belkin Wireless Play Max Router (F7D4301)?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item Belkin Wireless Play Max Router (F7D4301)? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with the item "Belkin Wireless Play Max Router (F7D4301)". First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Belkin Wireless Play Max Router (F7D4301)]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_862.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that the retrieved node ID is "brand_862", but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an error in the retrieval. I should try to retrieve the item node again with the exact title.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Belkin Wireless Play Max Router (F7D4301)]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_862.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node instead of an item node. This might indicate that the item title is not matching exactly. I should try to retrieve the node using a partial keyword or consider that the item might be listed under a slightly different name. Let me try with a more specific or different query.
Action 3: RetrieveNode[Belkin Wireless Play Max Router]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_862.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval is still returning a brand node. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with this title, or there might be an issue with the graph. Since the question is about co-viewed items, I need to find the item node first. Let me try to retrieve the brand node and then find its items, as the brand might be linked to its items.
Action 4: Thought 4: Since the retrieval is returning a brand node, I should check if this brand node has item nodes linked to it. The brand node might be associated with the item in question. Let me find the items linked to this brand.
Observation 4: 
Thought 5: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[brand_862, item]
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[brand_862, item]
Observation 5: The item neighbors of brand_862 are: ['B00APQ8A6A']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: Now I have an item node ID 'B00APQ8A6A' that belongs to brand_862. I should verify if this is the correct item by checking its title feature to confirm it matches "Belkin Wireless Play Max Router (F7D4301)".
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00APQ8A6A, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00APQ8A6A are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The title feature seems to be returning HTML code instead of the actual title. This might be a data issue. Let me try to retrieve the node using a different approach or check if there are other features that might help identify the item. Alternatively, I can proceed with the item node ID I have and assume it's the correct one for the purpose of finding co-viewed items.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00APQ8A6A, description]
Observation 7: The description feature of B00APQ8A6A are: ['Get your subscription to Nail It! Magazine to always stay up to date on the latest nail trends, designs and products.']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The description doesn't match a Belkin router, suggesting this might not be the correct item. Let me try a different approach to find the Belkin router item. I'll search for "Belkin" items more broadly.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Belkin]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_728.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The retrieval for "Belkin" returned a different brand node (brand_728). This suggests there might be multiple brand nodes for Belkin or the exact brand name is different. Let me try to retrieve the item directly with a more specific query including the model number.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[F7D4301]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 10: Thought 10: This is not working as expected. The retrieval function seems to be matching brand nodes instead of item nodes. Since the question is about co-viewed items, I need to find the correct item node. Let me try a different approach: I'll search for items that have "Belkin" in their title by checking the brand's items and then filtering by title.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Belkin Wireless Play Max Router F7D4301]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_862.
Thought 11: Thought 11: The retrieval consistently returns brand nodes, which suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable by its full title. Since the question is about co-viewed items, I need to find the correct item node. Let me try to find all items linked to brand_862 (which seems to be associated with Belkin) and then check their titles to identify the specific router item.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[brand_862, item]
Observation 11: The item neighbors of brand_862 are: ['B00APQ8A6A']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I only found one item linked to brand_862, but its description doesn't match a router. This suggests brand_862 might not be the correct brand for the Belkin router. Let me try with brand_728 (retrieved for "Belkin") to see if it has more items.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[brand_728, item]
Observation 12: The item neighbors of brand_728 are: ['B000INCK4I', 'B005DNAMPM', 'B005DNA3LU', 'B005DNCFP2', 'B005DNCU20', 'B005DNB4SG'].
