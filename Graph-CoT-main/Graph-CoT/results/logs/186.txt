Question: What is the substitutive item given this query: womens bic soleil?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the substitutive item given this query: womens bic soleil? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a "substitutive item" for the query "womens bic soleil". This seems to be asking for alternative or similar items. In the graph context, this likely means finding items that are related through connections like also_viewed_item, also_bought_item, etc. First, I need to find the item node corresponding to "womens bic soleil".
Action 1: RetrieveNode[womens bic soleil]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_245.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The retrieval returned a brand node (brand_245) instead of an item node. The query "womens bic soleil" might be referring to a brand rather than a specific item. Since the question asks for a "substitutive item," I need to find items associated with this brand first, and then look for substitutive items among them or their connections.
Action 2: Thought 2: Since I have a brand node (brand_245), I should first find all items associated with this brand to understand what products are available. Then I can look for substitutive items among these products or their connections.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to find the items associated with brand_245 first. Then I can look for substitutive items by examining connections like also_viewed_item or also_bought_item for those items.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_245, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_245 are: ['B00006KMW1', 'B00006KMVV', 'B00007AZEO', 'B00007KY38']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now I have the item nodes associated with the brand "womens bic soleil". To find substitutive items, I should look at the connections of these items, such as also_viewed_item or also_bought_item neighbors, which typically represent alternative or complementary products. I'll start by checking one of these items and its substitutive connections.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B00006KMW1, also_viewed_item]
Observation 4: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00006KMW1 are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The also_viewed_item neighbors for B00006KMW1 returned empty. I should try checking other relationship types that might indicate substitutive items, such as also_bought_item or buy_after_viewing_item. Alternatively, I could check the other items from this brand to see if they have substitutive connections.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00006KMW1, also_bought_item]
Observation 5: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00006KMW1 are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The also_bought_item neighbors for B00006KMW1 are also empty. I should try checking the other items from this brand to see if they have substitutive connections. Let me try another item node from the brand.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00006KMVV, also_viewed_item]
Observation 6: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00006KMVV are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The also_viewed_item neighbors for B00006KMVV are also empty. I should try checking other relationship types for this item, or try the remaining items from the brand. Let me check also_bought_item for B00006KMVV.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[B00006KMVV, also_bought_item]
Observation 7: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00006KMVV are: []. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: Both items I've checked so far have empty substitutive connections. Let me try the remaining items from this brand. I'll check B00007AZEO and B00007KY38 for their also_viewed_item or also_bought_item neighbors.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[B00007AZEO, also_viewed_item]
Observation 8: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00007AZEO are: []. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The also_viewed_item neighbors for B00007AZEO are also empty. Let me check the also_bought_item neighbors for this item, and then try the last item from the brand.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[B00007AZEO, also_bought_item]
Observation 9: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00007AZEO are: []. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: All the items associated with brand_245 seem to have empty substitutive connections when checking also_viewed_item and also_bought_item. Let me try the last item from this brand, B00007KY38, and check its substitutive connections. If that also returns empty, I might need to reconsider the approach - perhaps I should look at the category or other features of these items to find similar items, or check other relationship types like buy_after_viewing_item.
Action 10: Action 10: NeighbourCheck[B00007KY38, also_viewed_item]
Observation 10: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00007KY38 are: []. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: All the items associated with brand_245 have empty also_viewed_item and also_bought_item connections. I should try other relationship types that might indicate substitutive items, such as buy_after_viewing_item or bought_together_item. Let me check one of the items with these relationship types.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[B00006KMW1, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 11: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00006KMW1 are: []. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: All the standard substitutive relationship types (also_viewed_item, also_bought_item, buy_after_viewing_item) are returning empty for all items associated with brand_245. Let me try the remaining relationship type - bought_together_item - which might also indicate substitutive items.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[B00006KMW1, bought_together_item]
Observation 12: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00006KMW1 are: []. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: All the relationship types that typically indicate substitutive items are returning empty for all items associated with brand_245. This suggests that either these items don't have recorded substitutive connections in the graph, or I need to approach this differently. Since the question asks for a "substitutive item" given the query "womens bic soleil", and I've found that this refers to a brand rather than a specific item, perhaps I should look for items in the same category as the brand's products. I should first check the category of one of these items to understand what type of products they are, then look for other items in the same category that might serve as substitutes.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00006KMW1, category]
Observation 13: The category feature of B00006KMW1 are: []. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The category feature for B00006KMW1 returned empty. Let me check the category feature for another item from this brand to see if any of them have category information that could help identify substitutive items.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00006KMVV, category]
Observation 14: The category feature of B00006KMVV are: []. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The category features for these items are also empty. Let me check the remaining items from this brand to see if any have category information. If not, I should check their title or description features to understand what type of products they are, which might help identify potential substitutes.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00007AZEO, category]
Observation 15: The category feature of B00007AZEO are: [].
