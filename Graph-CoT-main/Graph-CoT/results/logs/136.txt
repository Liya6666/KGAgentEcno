Question: What is the average price of the co-viewed items with Night Watch?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the average price of the co-viewed items with Night Watch? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the average price of co-viewed items with "Night Watch". First, I need to find the item node for "Night Watch" to get its also_viewed_item neighbors.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Night Watch]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_276.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned a brand node (brand_276) instead of an item node. This suggests that "Night Watch" might be a brand name rather than an item title. I need to find the item node with "Night Watch" in its title or description. Let me try to search for items related to "Night Watch" to find the correct item node.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Night Watch item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BYTOWA.
Thought 3: Thought 3: Now I have an item node ID (B000BYTOWA) for "Night Watch". I need to find its also_viewed_item neighbors to get the co-viewed items.
Action 3: Thought 3: I have the item node ID for "Night Watch" (B000BYTOWA). Now I need to find its also_viewed_item neighbors to get the co-viewed items.
Observation 3: 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I need to get the also_viewed_item neighbors for the Night Watch item node (B000BYTOWA) to identify the co-viewed items.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B000BYTOWA, also_viewed_item]
Observation 4: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B000BYTOWA are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The observation shows that the Night Watch item node (B000BYTOWA) has no also_viewed_item neighbors. This might be because the item doesn't have any co-viewed items recorded, or there might be another item node for "Night Watch" that does have also_viewed_item neighbors. Let me try to find more information about this item node to verify if it's the correct one, and also check if there are other item nodes related to "Night Watch".
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B000BYTOWA, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B000BYTOWA are: Backpacking Light. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The item node B000BYTOWA has the title "Backpacking Light", not "Night Watch". This means my initial retrieval for "Night Watch item" didn't return the correct item. I need to find the actual "Night Watch" item node. Let me try a different approach to find the correct item node.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Night Watch movie]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_787.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm still getting brand nodes when searching for "Night Watch movie". This suggests that "Night Watch" might be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me try to search for items that might contain "Night Watch" in their title or description by using a more specific query.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Night Watch DVD]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B004D4UKPY.
Thought 8: Thought 8: Now I have a new item node ID (B004D4UKPY) from searching "Night Watch DVD". I should verify if this is the correct "Night Watch" item by checking its title feature.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B004D4UKPY, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B004D4UKPY are: TV Guide: Special Issue Star Wars The Phantom Menace Collector's Set. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: This item node also doesn't have "Night Watch" in its title. I need to find the correct "Night Watch" item node. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for "Night Watch" as a complete phrase might help, or I might need to consider that "Night Watch" could be part of a longer title.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode["Night Watch"]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_276.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I keep getting brand nodes when searching for "Night Watch". This suggests that "Night Watch" might primarily be a brand name in this graph. However, the question is asking about co-viewed items with "Night Watch", implying it should be an item. Let me try to find items that belong to the Night Watch brand, as one of them might be the intended item.
Action 10: Action 10: NeighbourCheck[brand_276, item]
Observation 10: The item neighbors of brand_276 are: ['B00006KNVS', 'B00006KQ19']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: Now I have two item nodes (B00006KNVS and B00006KQ19) that belong to the Night Watch brand. I need to check their titles to see if either is specifically called "Night Watch" or if one of them is the intended item for the question.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00006KNVS, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B00006KNVS are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The title feature for B00006KNVS appears to be HTML code rather than a readable title. This might be a data issue. Let me check the other item node from the Night Watch brand to see if it has a proper title.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00006KQ19, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B00006KQ19 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 13: Thought 13: Both item nodes from the Night Watch brand have HTML code as their title features, which is not helpful. I need to find another way to identify the "Night Watch" item. Perhaps I should search for items with "Night Watch" in their description or category features, or try a different retrieval approach. Let me try to search for "Night Watch" with a different query that might return an item node.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Night Watch book]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_489.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm still getting brand nodes when searching for "Night Watch book". This is becoming frustrating. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for "Night Watch" as part of a more specific item description might help. I should also consider that "Night Watch" might be a movie, book, or other product, so let me try a broader search.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Night Watch Terry Pratchett]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_425.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I keep getting brand nodes when searching for "Night Watch" variations. This suggests that "Night Watch" might be primarily represented as a brand in this graph rather than an item. However, the question specifically asks about co-viewed items with "Night Watch", implying it should be an item. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I should search for items that have "Night Watch" in their title using a wildcard or partial match approach, though the RetrieveNode function might not support that. Alternatively, I could check if any of the brand nodes have "Night Watch" in their name, and then find their items to see if any have proper titles.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[brand_276, name]
Observation 15: The name feature of brand_276 are: Midnight Call Ministry.
Correct answer: 22.76
