Question: What is the usual price of the items often purchased together with PYLE-PRO PPHP1293 - 800 Watt 12'' Two-Way Plastic Molded Loudspeaker?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the usual price of the items often purchased together with PYLE-PRO PPHP1293 - 800 Watt 12'' Two-Way Plastic Molded Loudspeaker? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the usual price of items often purchased together with a specific item (PYLE-PRO PPHP1293 - 800 Watt 12'' Two-Way Plastic Molded Loudspeaker). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[PYLE-PRO PPHP1293 - 800 Watt 12'' Two-Way Plastic Molded Loudspeaker]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_493.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_493" as the ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the item node again with the exact title.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[PYLE-PRO PPHP1293 - 800 Watt 12'' Two-Way Plastic Molded Loudspeaker]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_493.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node (brand_493) instead of an item node. This suggests that the item title might be associated with a brand name. I should try to find the item node by searching for a partial match or by considering that "PYLE-PRO" might be the brand name. Let me try to retrieve the brand node first to understand the situation better.
Action 3: Thought 3: Since the retrieval is returning a brand node instead of an item node, I should check if "PYLE-PRO" is actually a brand name. Let me examine the brand node that was returned to understand its properties.
Observation 3: 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Since the retrieval is returning a brand node (brand_493) instead of an item node, I should first examine this brand node to understand its properties and see if it's related to the item in question.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[brand_493, name]
Observation 4: The name feature of brand_493 are: Sound on Sound Ltd. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The brand node brand_493 has the name "Sound on Sound Ltd.", which doesn't match "PYLE-PRO". This suggests that the retrieval might be incorrect or there's a mismatch. Let me try to retrieve the item node with a different approach. Perhaps the item title is stored differently in the graph. I should try to search for a partial match or consider that "PYLE-PRO" might be part of the brand name. Let me try to retrieve nodes with keywords from the item title.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[PPHP1293]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_866.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieval is still returning brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with the given title, or there might be an issue with how the graph is structured. Let me try to retrieve using "PYLE-PRO" as a brand name to see if I can find related items, and then look for the specific item from there.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[PYLE-PRO]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_58.
Thought 7: Thought 7: Now I have retrieved brand_58 with the keyword "PYLE-PRO". Let me check the name of this brand to confirm if it's the correct brand for the item in question.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[brand_58, name]
Observation 7: The name feature of brand_58 are: Pro Circ. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The brand retrieved with "PYLE-PRO" is "Pro Circ", which doesn't match "PYLE-PRO". This suggests that the item might not be in the graph with the exact title provided. Let me try a different approach and search for the item using more specific keywords from the title, such as "800 Watt 12'' Two-Way Plastic Molded Loudspeaker".
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[800 Watt 12'' Two-Way Plastic Molded Loudspeaker]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_493.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The retrieval is consistently returning brand nodes instead of item nodes, which suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with the given title. However, the question is about items purchased together with this specific item. Since I cannot find the item node directly, I should try to find the item through its brand or other connections. Let me try to find items related to the brand that might be associated with "PYLE-PRO". From previous attempts, "PYLE-PRO" might be a brand, but the exact match isn't working. Let me try to retrieve the brand node for "Pyle" or "PRO" to see if I can find the correct brand.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Pyle]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_78.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I retrieved brand_78 with "Pyle". Let me check the name of this brand to see if it matches "PYLE-PRO" or is related.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[brand_78, name]
Observation 10: The name feature of brand_78 are: Duncan Mcintosh. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: This is not working as expected. The retrieval seems to be matching keywords in unexpected ways. Let me try a different approach. Since the item title is long, perhaps I should try to retrieve it using a unique part of the title, like "PPHP1293", but earlier that returned a brand. Let me try to retrieve the item by searching for "PYLE-PRO" as a brand and then look for its items, assuming that "PYLE-PRO" is the brand name for this item.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[PYLE-PRO]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_58.
Thought 12: Thought 12: The retrieval is consistently returning brand nodes instead of the expected item node. This suggests that the item "PYLE-PRO PPHP1293 - 800 Watt 12'' Two-Way Plastic Molded Loudspeaker" might not be directly retrievable with the given title. However, since the question is about items purchased together with this specific item, I need to find a way to locate it. Let me try to find items that have "PPHP1293" in their title or description by checking if there are any item nodes linked to the brands that were retrieved.
Action 12: Thought 12: Since direct retrieval isn't working, I should try to find items related to the brands that were retrieved with keywords from the title. Let me first check what items are linked to brand_58 (which was retrieved with "PYLE-PRO") to see if any match the item description.
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Thought 13: Since direct retrieval isn't working, I should try to find items related to the brands that were retrieved with keywords from the title. Let me first check what items are linked to brand_58 (which was retrieved with "PYLE-PRO") to see if any match the item description.
Action 13: Action 13: NeighbourCheck[brand_58, item]
Observation 13: The item neighbors of brand_58 are: ['B00005N7XF', 'B00009MGE5']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I have two item nodes from brand_58: 'B00005N7XF' and 'B00009MGE5'. Let me check their titles to see if either matches the item in question.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00005N7XF, title]
Observation 14: The title feature of B00005N7XF are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The title feature seems to be returning HTML code instead of the actual title. This might be an issue with the graph data. Let me try the other item node to see if it has a proper title.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00009MGE5, title]
Observation 15: The title feature of B00009MGE5 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary".
Correct answer: 12.95
