Question: Which items from publisher Eye Spy Publishing Ltd have the most also-viewed items?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which items from publisher Eye Spy Publishing Ltd have the most also-viewed items? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items from a specific publisher (Eye Spy Publishing Ltd). First, I need to find the brand node corresponding to this publisher name. Then, I need to find all items linked to this brand. For each item, I need to check the number of also_viewed_item neighbors. Finally, I need to identify which items have the highest count and return their titles.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Eye Spy Publishing Ltd]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_627.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the brand node ID. I need to find all items linked to this brand to identify which items belong to Eye Spy Publishing Ltd.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_627, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_627 are: ['B0002SZUUK']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I see that there is only one item linked to this brand: 'B0002SZUUK'. Since there's only one item from this publisher, it automatically has the most also-viewed items (as it's the only one). Now I need to find the number of also_viewed_item neighbors for this item to confirm, and then get its title to answer the question.
Action 3: NodeDegree[B0002SZUUK, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B0002SZUUK are: 1. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The item has 1 also_viewed_item neighbor. Now I need to get the title of this item to provide the answer.
Action 4: NodeFeature[B0002SZUUK, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B0002SZUUK are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature seems to contain HTML markup. I need to extract the actual title text. Let me try to get a cleaner version of the title feature.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B0002SZUUK, description]
Observation 5: The description feature of B0002SZUUK are: ["The world's leading newsstand publication on espionage and intelligence. Also, includes articles on terrorism and world events.", '', '']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The description doesn't give me the title. Let me try to get the title feature again, but perhaps there's a cleaner way to extract it. I should also check if there are other features that might contain the item name.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B0002SZUUK, category]
Observation 6: The category feature of B0002SZUUK are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional &amp; Educational Journals', 'Professional &amp; Trade', 'Humanities &amp; Social Sciences', 'Military Science']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The category information doesn't give me the title either. Let me try to get the title feature again, but this time I'll look for a cleaner representation. Perhaps the title is stored in a different format or I need to parse the HTML content.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[B0002SZUUK]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I seem to have made an error. The RetrieveNode action should return the node ID when given a title or identifier, but I already have the node ID from Observation 2. Let me try to get the title feature again, but perhaps I need to handle the HTML content differently. Since the title feature contains HTML markup, I should extract the text content from it.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B0002SZUUK, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B0002SZUUK are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title feature appears to be incomplete or malformed in the response. Let me try to get the complete title by checking if there's a way to extract the text content from the HTML. Alternatively, I should check if there are other item nodes linked to this brand, as Observation 2 might have been incomplete.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[brand_627, item]
Observation 9: The item neighbors of brand_627 are: ['B0002SZUUK']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: Since there's only one item from this publisher, and I'm having trouble getting a clean title from the title feature, I should try to extract the actual text from the HTML content. The title appears to be wrapped in a span tag. Let me try to get the complete title by looking at the raw content or checking if there's another way to access it.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B0002SZUUK, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B0002SZUUK are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The title feature seems to be consistently returning incomplete HTML. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I can use the RetrieveNode function with the item ID to get more complete information, or check if there's another way to access the title. Since I need to provide the item's main feature (name/title), I should persist in trying to extract the actual title text.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[B0002SZUUK]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm getting inconsistent results. When I retrieve the node by its ID B0002SZUUK, it's returning brand_756 instead of confirming the item node. This suggests there might be an issue with the node ID or the graph structure. Let me try to retrieve the item node using a different approach - perhaps by searching for items related to Eye Spy Publishing Ltd directly.
Action 12: Thought 12: I seem to be encountering inconsistencies in the graph responses. Let me try a different approach. Since I know the brand node is brand_627 (Eye Spy Publishing Ltd), I should verify its features first, then try to get the item information more carefully.
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I need to verify the brand node features first to ensure I have the correct node, then try to get the item information more systematically.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[brand_627, name]
Observation 13: The name feature of brand_627 are: Eye Spy Publishing Ltd. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: Good, I've confirmed that brand_627 is indeed Eye Spy Publishing Ltd. Now I need to get the complete list of items from this publisher. Let me try the neighbor check again to ensure I have all items.
Action 14: Action 14: NeighbourCheck[brand_627, item]
Observation 14: The item neighbors of brand_627 are: ['B0002SZUUK']. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: Since there's only one item from this publisher, I need to find a way to extract its actual title. The previous attempts to get the title feature returned incomplete HTML. Let me try to get the complete title by checking if there's a way to parse the HTML content or if there's another feature that contains the item name.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B0002SZUUK, description]
Observation 15: The description feature of B0002SZUUK are: ["The world's leading newsstand publication on espionage and intelligence. Also, includes articles on terrorism and world events.", '', ''].
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
