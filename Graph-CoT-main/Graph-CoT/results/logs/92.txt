Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item The New Soul Food Cookbook: Healthier Recipes for Traditional Favorites?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item The New Soul Food Cookbook: Healthier Recipes for Traditional Favorites? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with "The New Soul Food Cookbook: Healthier Recipes for Traditional Favorites". First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[The New Soul Food Cookbook: Healthier Recipes for Traditional Favorites]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BKPPRM.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the also_viewed_item neighbors of this item to understand what items are co-viewed with it.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B000BKPPRM, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B000BKPPRM are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the item has no also_viewed_item neighbors. This seems unusual. Perhaps I should verify the node ID or check if there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try retrieving the node again with the exact title.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[The New Soul Food Cookbook: Healthier Recipes for Traditional Favorites]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BKPPRM.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval consistently returns the same node ID, but it has no also_viewed_item neighbors. This suggests that either the item truly has no co-viewed items, or there might be an issue with how the graph is structured. However, the question asks for items that share over 4 co-viewed items with this one, which implies that there should be some also_viewed_item relationships. Perhaps I should check the node's features to confirm it is the correct item.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B000BKPPRM, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B000BKPPRM are: Cooking With Paula Deen. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieved node has a different title ("Cooking With Paula Deen") than what was queried ("The New Soul Food Cookbook: Healthier Recipes for Traditional Favorites"). This indicates that the initial retrieval might have been incorrect. I should try to retrieve the node with the exact title from the question.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[The New Soul Food Cookbook: Healthier Recipes for Traditional Favorites]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BKPPRM.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieval consistently returns the same node ID (B000BKPPRM) but with a different title feature. This suggests that the graph might have inconsistencies or that the item node might have been mislabeled. However, I need to proceed with the given node since it's the only one retrieved. The question is about finding items that share over 4 co-viewed items with this item. Since this item has no also_viewed_item neighbors, it cannot share any co-viewed items with other items. Therefore, no item shares over 4 co-viewed items with it. But to be thorough, I should check if there are other items that have also_viewed_item relationships and see if any of them might indirectly relate to this item, though the question specifically asks about sharing co-viewed items.
Action 6: Thought 6: Since the retrieved node has no also_viewed_item neighbors, it cannot share any co-viewed items with other items. However, to fully answer the question, I should consider if there might be other items that have this item in their also_viewed_item list, which could indicate a one-way relationship. But the question asks about "sharing" co-viewed items, which typically implies mutual relationships. Given that this item has no also_viewed_item neighbors, it is unlikely that any item shares over 4 co-viewed items with it. Therefore, the answer should be that no such item exists.
Observation 6: 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieved node has a title that doesn't match the query, and it has no also_viewed_item neighbors. However, the question specifically asks about "The New Soul Food Cookbook: Healthier Recipes for Traditional Favorites". I should try to retrieve the node using a different approach, perhaps by using keywords from the title that might be more accurate.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[New Soul Food Cookbook]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BKPPRM.
Thought 8: Thought 8: The retrieval still returns the same node ID (B000BKPPRM) with the mismatched title. This suggests that in this graph, the node with ID B000BKPPRM might be incorrectly labeled or there might be a data issue. However, I need to work with what's available in the graph. Since this node has no also_viewed_item neighbors (as observed in Action 2), it cannot share any co-viewed items with other items. Therefore, no item shares over 4 co-viewed items with it. To confirm this conclusion, I should check if there are any items that have B000BKPPRM in their also_viewed_item list, but even if there are, since B000BKPPRM has no also_viewed_item neighbors, it wouldn't share any co-viewed items with others. The question asks for sharing, which implies mutual co-viewed items.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeDegree[B000BKPPRM, also_viewed_item]
Observation 8: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B000BKPPRM are: 0. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The node degree confirms that B000BKPPRM has 0 also_viewed_item neighbors. Therefore, it cannot share any co-viewed items with other items, let alone over 4. Since no item shares over 4 co-viewed items with it, I should conclude that there is no such item.
Action 9: Based on the graph interactions, the item node retrieved for "The New Soul Food Cookbook: Healthier Recipes for Traditional Favorites" has ID B000BKPPRM, but its title feature is "Cooking With Paula Deen". This node has 0 also_viewed_item neighbors (co-viewed items). Therefore, it cannot share any co-viewed items with other items, and no item shares over 4 co-viewed items with it.
Observation 9: 
Thought 10: Action 9: Finish[No such item exists]
Action 10: Finish[No such item exists]
Observation 10: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Healthy Soul Food Cooking
