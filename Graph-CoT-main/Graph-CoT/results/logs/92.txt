Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item with a specific title containing HTML-like text: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". First, I need to find the item node with this title in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00005N7NQ), I need to understand what "format" means in this context. Since the question asks for the format of the item and specifies to provide node main features rather than IDs, I should look at the item's features. The available features for items are: title, description, price, img, category. "Format" might refer to the category or possibly the description. Let me check the category feature first, as that often describes the format of an item (e.g., DVD, book, digital).
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 2: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The category information shows this is a magazine subscription, but "format" might refer to something more specific like physical vs digital format. Let me check the description feature to see if it contains format information.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 3: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The description provides content details but doesn't explicitly mention the format. Since this is categorized as a magazine subscription, the format could be "Magazine" or "Subscription." However, I should check if there are any other features that might indicate format. The title itself contains HTML-like text which might suggest this is a digital or online format. Let me check the title feature to see the complete title.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature appears to be HTML code, which strongly suggests this is a digital item or an online listing. The question specifically asks for the "format" of the item. Given that this appears to be a magazine subscription (from the category) and has an HTML title, the format is likely "Digital" or "Online." However, I should check if there are any other clues. Let me check if this item has any brand information or other features that might indicate format.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 5: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I have the brand node ID. Let me check the brand name to see if it provides any format information.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 6: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The brand name "Reason Magazine" confirms this is a magazine. Given that the title contains HTML code and it's a magazine subscription, the format is likely digital/online. However, I should check if there's a more specific format mentioned in the features. Let me check if there are any other relevant features or neighbors that might indicate format.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, img]
Observation 7: The img feature of B00005N7NQ are: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Iph04Jy3L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The image URL doesn't provide clear format information. Based on all the information gathered:
Action 8: Thought 8: Based on all the information gathered: The item has a title containing HTML code, is categorized as a magazine subscription, and has a brand name "Reason Magazine." The format appears to be a digital/online magazine subscription, as indicated by the HTML elements in the title which suggest this is an online listing rather than a physical product.
Observation 8: 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The question asks for the "format" of the item. Based on the evidence gathered:
Action 9: Finish[Digital Magazine Subscription]
