Question: What is the leading category name of items frequently bought together with Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush, 2-Inch Diameter?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the leading category name of items frequently bought together with Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush, 2-Inch Diameter? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the leading category name of items frequently bought together with a specific item. First, I need to find the node for "Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush, 2-Inch Diameter" in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush, 2-Inch Diameter]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_537.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_537" as the ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should verify if this is correct or if there's a mismatch. Perhaps the item name is slightly different in the graph. Let me try to retrieve the node again with a more precise or alternative query.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush 2-Inch Diameter]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_537.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node (brand_537) instead of an item node. This suggests that "Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush, 2-Inch Diameter" might actually be a brand name rather than an item title in this graph. Let me check the features of this brand node to confirm.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[brand_537, name]
Observation 3: The name feature of brand_537 are: American Paint Horse Assn. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The observation shows that brand_537 has the name "American Paint Horse Assn.", which doesn't match "Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush, 2-Inch Diameter". This indicates that my initial retrieval was incorrect. I need to find the correct item node. Let me try a different approach by searching for keywords from the item name.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[Porcupine Rounder Brush]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_139.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval is still returning brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with these keywords, or I need to be more specific. Let me try to include the full name but perhaps with different formatting or keywords.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Spornette Porcupine]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_406.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve "Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush, 2-Inch Diameter". This suggests that either the item name is different in the graph, or I need to approach this differently. Let me try searching for just "Spornette" as it might be the brand name, and then look for items from that brand.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Spornette]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_916.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm still getting brand nodes when searching for "Spornette". Let me check the features of brand_916 to confirm if this is the Spornette brand.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[brand_916, name]
Observation 7: The name feature of brand_916 are: Sunatoria. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The name "Sunatoria" doesn't match "Spornette". This indicates that my retrieval attempts are not working correctly. Let me try a different approach. Since the question mentions "Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush, 2-Inch Diameter" as an item, perhaps I need to search for it as an item title rather than as a general node. Let me try to retrieve it with the exact title but using the item node type specification if possible. However, since the function doesn't allow specifying node type, I need to think differently. Maybe I should look for items that have "Porcupine Rounder Brush" in their title by trying different keyword combinations.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Rounder Brush]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_139.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve with various keywords. This suggests that either the item doesn't exist in the graph with that exact name, or I need to approach this differently. Let me try searching for "2-Inch Diameter" which might be more unique to this specific item.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[2-Inch Diameter]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J81K.
Thought 10: Thought 10: Great! I finally got an item node ID (B00007J81K) instead of a brand node. Now I need to verify if this is the correct item by checking its title feature.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00007J81K, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B00007J81K are: Scale Aviation Modeller International. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The title "Scale Aviation Modeller International" doesn't match "Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush, 2-Inch Diameter". This suggests that "2-Inch Diameter" might not be a good search term either. Let me try a different approach. Since the question mentions "Spornette" as likely a brand name, let me search for items with "Porcupine" in their title, which might be more specific to this brush.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Porcupine]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7SH.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I got an item node ID (B00005N7SH) when searching for "Porcupine". Let me check its title to see if it matches the item in question.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00005N7SH, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B00005N7SH are: Reptiles (1-year). 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The title "Reptiles (1-year)" doesn't match the item I'm looking for. This approach isn't working well. Let me try searching for "Spornette" as part of the title rather than as a brand. Perhaps the item has "Spornette" in its title.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Spornette]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_916.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm still getting brand nodes when searching for "Spornette". This suggests that "Spornette" might be a brand name in the graph, but the item I'm looking for might have a different title. Let me try searching for the full item name but with different formatting or without commas.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Spornette Porcupine Rounder Brush 2 Inch Diameter]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_139.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with the exact name. Since the question is about items frequently bought together with this specific item, I need to find the correct item node first. Let me try a different approach by searching for "Rounder Brush" which might be part of the item title, but this time I'll check if there are multiple nodes with similar names by looking at neighbors or other features. However, since RetrieveNode seems to return only one node, I might need to find the item through its brand or other means. Let me assume that "Spornette" is the brand and try to find items from that brand.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Spornette brand]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_204.
