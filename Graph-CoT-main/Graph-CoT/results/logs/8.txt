Question: What is the brand of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the brand of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the brand of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary""). This looks like HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the correct item node, but the given title seems invalid. Let me try to retrieve the node anyway to see if it exists in the graph.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The retrieval was successful, and I got the node ID B00005N7NQ. Now I need to find the brand of this item. To do this, I should check the brand neighbors of this item node.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 2: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I have the brand node ID 'brand_0'. Now I need to get the actual brand name by checking the name feature of this brand node, as the question asks for the main feature (name) rather than the node ID.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 3: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have found that the brand name for the item with the incomplete title is "Reason Magazine". This answers the question about the brand of the item.
Action 4: Finish[Reason Magazine]
Observation 4: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: General Media Publishing
