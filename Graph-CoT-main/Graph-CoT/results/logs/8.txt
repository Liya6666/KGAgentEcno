Question: Can you tell me the brand of the item Speedball Mona Lisa 18-Inch-by-24-Inch Jumbo Graphite Paper, Black?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you tell me the brand of the item Speedball Mona Lisa 18-Inch-by-24-Inch Jumbo Graphite Paper, Black? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the brand of a specific item node (Speedball Mona Lisa 18-Inch-by-24-Inch Jumbo Graphite Paper, Black). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Speedball Mona Lisa 18-Inch-by-24-Inch Jumbo Graphite Paper, Black]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_908.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned a node ID of "brand_908", but the question is asking about an item, not a brand. This seems incorrect. I should verify if this is indeed the correct node for the item title. Perhaps there was a mismatch in the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the node again with the exact item title.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Speedball Mona Lisa 18-Inch-by-24-Inch Jumbo Graphite Paper, Black]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_908.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node (brand_908) instead of an item node. This suggests that the item title might be incorrectly mapped or there's an issue with the retrieval. Since the question is about finding the brand of an item, and I have a brand node ID, I should check if this brand node is connected to the actual item node. However, I need to find the item node first. Let me try to retrieve the node using a partial keyword or alternative approach. Perhaps the full title is too long, so I'll try with a shorter key phrase.
Action 3: RetrieveNode[Speedball Mona Lisa Jumbo Graphite Paper]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00K05O272.
Thought 4: Thought 4: Great! Now I have an item node ID (B00K05O272) that seems to correspond to the item in question. The question asks for the brand of this item. I need to find the brand node connected to this item node and then get the brand name.
Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B00K05O272, brand]
Observation 4: The brand neighbors of B00K05O272 are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The NeighbourCheck returned an empty list for brand neighbors, which is unexpected. This might indicate that the item node doesn't have a direct brand connection, or there might be an issue with the node. Let me verify the node features to confirm this is indeed the correct item node, and then check if there are other relationship types that might connect to the brand.
Action 5: NodeFeature[B00K05O272, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00K05O272 are: Lego Club Magazine May-june 2014. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieved node B00K05O272 has a title "Lego Club Magazine May-june 2014", which doesn't match the item I'm looking for. This indicates that my partial keyword retrieval didn't find the correct item. I need to try a different approach to find the exact item node for "Speedball Mona Lisa 18-Inch-by-24-Inch Jumbo Graphite Paper, Black". Let me try retrieving with a more specific but shorter key phrase from the title.
Action 6: RetrieveNode[Mona Lisa Jumbo Graphite Paper]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_520.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve with various parts of the title. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with the exact title, or there might be an issue with how the graph is structured. Let me try a different approach - since I got brand_908 earlier which might be related, let me check what that brand node contains and see if it has any connection to the item.
Action 7: NodeFeature[brand_908, name]
Observation 7: The name feature of brand_908 are: Diverti Editions - Dept Arts. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The brand_908 node has the name "Diverti Editions - Dept Arts", which doesn't seem to match "Speedball" or "Mona Lisa" from the item title. This suggests that brand_908 might not be the correct brand for the item I'm looking for. Let me try a different retrieval approach - perhaps using "Speedball" as the keyword since it's likely the brand name in the item title.
Action 8: RetrieveNode[Speedball]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_176.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I retrieved a brand node (brand_176) with the keyword "Speedball". Since the question is about finding the brand of a specific item, I should check if this brand node is connected to the item in question. However, I need to find the item node first. Let me try to retrieve the item using a more precise keyword combination that includes both the brand and product name.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Speedball Mona Lisa Graphite Paper]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00K05O272.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I retrieved node B00K05O272 again, but earlier I found that this node has the title "Lego Club Magazine May-june 2014", which doesn't match the item I'm looking for. This suggests that the retrieval function might be returning incorrect matches. Let me try a different approach - I'll check what items are connected to the Speedball brand node (brand_176) to see if the target item is among them.
Action 10: Action 10: NeighbourCheck[brand_176, item]
Observation 10: The item neighbors of brand_176 are: ['B00006K5RP']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The brand node brand_176 (Speedball) has only one item neighbor: B00006K5RP. I should check if this item node matches the target item title "Speedball Mona Lisa 18-Inch-by-24-Inch Jumbo Graphite Paper, Black".
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00006K5RP, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B00006K5RP are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The title feature returned HTML code instead of a readable title, which is unusual. This might be a data issue. Let me try to retrieve the description or other features to identify this item, or try a different approach to find the correct item node. Since the question specifically asks for the brand of "Speedball Mona Lisa 18-Inch-by-24-Inch Jumbo Graphite Paper, Black", I should try to search for this item using a different method. Let me try to retrieve the node with the exact full title again, but perhaps there's a specific format or encoding issue.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode["Speedball Mona Lisa 18-Inch-by-24-Inch Jumbo Graphite Paper, Black"]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006K98C.
Thought 13: Thought 13: Great! Now I have a different node ID (B00006K98C) when using the exact full title in quotes. This might be the correct item node. I should verify its title to confirm it matches the query.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00006K98C, title]
Observation 13: The title feature of B00006K98C are: Cmyk Magazine. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The title "Cmyk Magazine" still doesn't match the target item. This is frustrating. Let me try a different approach. Since the item title contains "Speedball" which is likely the brand, and "Mona Lisa" which might be part of the product name, let me try to find all items that have "Mona Lisa" in their title by checking if there's a node with that keyword.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Mona Lisa]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_820.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve with various keywords from the item title. This suggests that the graph might not have the exact item node I'm looking for, or there might be an issue with how items are indexed. Let me try a different approach - since "Speedball" appears to be a brand name, let me check what items are connected to the Speedball brand node (brand_176) that I found earlier, and see if any of them match the description.
Action 15: Action 15: NeighbourCheck[brand_176, item]
Observation 15: The item neighbors of brand_176 are: ['B00006K5RP'].
Correct answer: Speedball
