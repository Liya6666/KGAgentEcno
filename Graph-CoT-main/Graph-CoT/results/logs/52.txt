Question: How many buy-after-viewing items does item National Floral Flannel Nightgown have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many buy-after-viewing items does item National Floral Flannel Nightgown have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the buy-after-viewing items of the item "National Floral Flannel Nightgown". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[National Floral Flannel Nightgown]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the node ID for the item. The question asks for the number of buy-after-viewing items, but specifically requests that I provide the main feature (names) of these items rather than just a count. I need to first find all the buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of this node, then get their titles (the main feature for items).
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00007J82Z, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 2: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00007J82Z are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that there are no buy_after_viewing_item neighbors for this item. This means the item has zero buy-after-viewing items. Since the question asks for the number and to provide the main feature (names), but there are none, I should report that there are no such items.
Action 3: Finish[0]
Observation 3: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 0
