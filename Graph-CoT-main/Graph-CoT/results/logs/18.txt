Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?"). This looks like HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to find a way to identify the correct item node despite this incomplete title.

Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: Since the item title appears to be corrupted HTML code, I cannot directly retrieve the node using this string. I need to find another approach. Perhaps I should look for items that might have this HTML fragment in their title or description features, or maybe this is a placeholder that needs to be interpreted differently. Let me try to search for nodes that might contain this text pattern.

Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The RetrieveNode function typically expects a complete item title as shown in the examples. Since the given text appears to be HTML code rather than a proper title, I should try to interpret what this might represent. The text "<span class=\"a-size-medium a-color-secondary\"" looks like it could be part of an Amazon product page where this class might be used for secondary text like "price" or other product information. Perhaps this is indicating that we need to find an item where the price is displayed with this specific CSS class. Let me try to search for items that might have this HTML fragment in their description or other features.
