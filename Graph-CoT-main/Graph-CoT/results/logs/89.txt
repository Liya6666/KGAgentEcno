Question: What is the publisher of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the publisher of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the publisher of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?"). This looks like HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to clarify what the actual item is before proceeding.
Action 1: Thought 1: The question appears to have an incomplete or corrupted item title containing HTML code ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?"). This doesn't look like a valid item title that would exist in the graph. I should first try to retrieve this node as given, but if it fails, I may need to reconsider the question or look for alternative approaches.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 1: The question contains what appears to be HTML code ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?") rather than a proper item title. This is likely not a valid node identifier in the graph. However, I should attempt to retrieve it as given, as the graph might have nodes with unusual titles or this could be a test case.
