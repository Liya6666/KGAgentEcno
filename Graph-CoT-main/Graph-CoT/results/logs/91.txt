Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item, but the item name appears to be incomplete or malformed ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary""). This looks like it might be HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the node using this string to see if it exists in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have retrieved the node ID B00005N7NQ. The question is asking about the "format" of this item. Looking at the available features for item nodes (title, description, price, img, category), "format" might correspond to one of these features. Since "format" often relates to media type or category, I should check the category feature first.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 2: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The category information shows this is a magazine/journal subscription, but the question specifically asks about "format." Format might refer to the physical/digital format of the item. Since "format" isn't explicitly listed as a feature, I should check other features like "description" or "title" which might contain format information.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 3: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The description provides content details but doesn't explicitly mention the format. Since this appears to be a magazine/journal subscription, the format is likely "Magazine" or "Journal Subscription." However, I should check if there's more specific format information in the title or other features. Let me examine the title feature.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: I see that the title feature itself contains the HTML code "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". This suggests that the item's title might be incomplete or that the data extraction process captured HTML markup instead of the actual title text. Since the question asks for the "format" of the item, and the available features don't have a direct "format" field, I should consider what "format" might mean in this context. Given that the categories indicate this is a magazine/journal subscription, and the description confirms it's a publication called "REASON," the format is likely "Magazine" or "Journal." Let me check if there are any other relevant neighbors or features that might indicate format.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, img]
Observation 5: The img feature of B00005N7NQ are: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Iph04Jy3L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The image URL doesn't provide format information. Since "format" isn't a direct feature and the title appears to be HTML markup rather than meaningful text, I should consider the category information as the best indicator of format. The categories clearly indicate this is a magazine/journal subscription. The most specific format would be "Magazine Subscription" or "Journal Subscription" based on the categories provided.
Action 6: Action 6: Finish[Magazine Subscription]
Observation 6: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Print Magazine
