Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT Size: 1/2 OZ?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT Size: 1/2 OZ? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with the item "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT Size: 1/2 OZ". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT Size: 1/2 OZ]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_295.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned a brand node (brand_295) instead of an item node. This suggests that "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT Size: 1/2 OZ" might actually be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me check the features of this brand node to confirm.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_295, name]
Observation 2: The name feature of brand_295 are: New Scientist Ltd. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that brand_295 has the name "New Scientist Ltd.", which doesn't match the query "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT Size: 1/2 OZ". This suggests that my initial retrieval might have been incorrect. I should try to retrieve the item node using a more specific approach or different keywords. Let me try to retrieve the item node using the full title but perhaps with a different strategy.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_644.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT" might be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me try to retrieve the item using a different approach - perhaps by including "Size: 1/2 OZ" which might be part of the item description rather than the title.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[TEARS EYE LUBRICANT Size: 1/2 OZ]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_627.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm consistently retrieving brand nodes instead of item nodes when searching for "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT". This suggests that this might actually be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for items that might contain these keywords in their title or description features.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[TEARS EYE LUBRICANT]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_185.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently retrieving brand nodes when searching for variations of "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT", which suggests this is likely a brand name rather than an item title. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for items that might be related to this brand or contain these keywords in their description.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[MURINE TEARS]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_644.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm consistently retrieving brand nodes when searching for "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT" variations, which suggests this is likely a brand name. However, the question specifically refers to it as an "item". Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for items that might contain "MURINE" or "TEARS" in their title or description features, and then check if any of them match the full description.
Action 7: Thought 7: Since direct retrieval isn't working, I need to find items related to this brand first, then look for the specific item with "Size: 1/2 OZ" in its features. Let me first find all items under the brand that contains "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT".
Observation 7: 
Thought 8: Thought 8: Since direct retrieval of the item isn't working, I should first identify the correct brand node for "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT" and then find its items. From previous observations, brand_644 seems to be associated with "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT". Let me check its name feature to confirm.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[brand_644, name]
Observation 8: The name feature of brand_644 are: Wild Fibers. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The name "Wild Fibers" doesn't match "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT". Let me try another brand node from previous observations. I recall brand_295 had "New Scientist Ltd." and brand_185 was also retrieved. Let me check brand_185's name feature.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[brand_185, name]
Observation 9: The name feature of brand_185 are: Cornucopia. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm not finding a brand that matches "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT" through direct retrieval. Perhaps the item title is different from what I'm searching for. Let me try a different approach - searching for items that might contain "MURINE" or "TEARS" in their title or description, and then check if any match the full description including "Size: 1/2 OZ".
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[MURINE]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_644.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm still retrieving brand nodes when searching for "MURINE". This suggests that "MURINE" might be a brand name rather than part of an item title. Let me try a different approach - perhaps the item title is different or I need to search for items with "TEARS EYE LUBRICANT" in their description rather than title.
Action 11: Thought 11: Since direct retrieval isn't working, I need to find items that might contain "TEARS EYE LUBRICANT" or similar terms in their description. Let me try to search for items with "EYE LUBRICANT" which might be more specific to the product type.
Observation 11: 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm having difficulty retrieving the correct item node directly. Let me try a different approach - searching for "EYE LUBRICANT" which might be more specific to the product type and could help identify the item.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[EYE LUBRICANT]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_185.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm still retrieving brand nodes when searching for "EYE LUBRICANT". This suggests that these terms might be associated with brands rather than item titles. Let me try a different approach - perhaps the item title is different or I need to search for items with "TEARS" or "LUBRICANT" in their description. Let me try searching for "TEARS" which might be more specific.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[TEARS]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_888.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently retrieving brand nodes when searching for various keywords from the query, which suggests that "MURINE TEARS EYE LUBRICANT" is likely a brand name rather than an item title. However, the question specifically refers to it as an "item". Let me try a different approach - perhaps the item has a different title but contains "Size: 1/2 OZ" in its description or features. Let me search for items with "1/2 OZ" in their description.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[1/2 OZ]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0007XWHVK.
Thought 15: Thought 15: Observation 14 returns a node ID "B0007XWHVK", which appears to be an item node (not a brand node). This suggests that searching for "1/2 OZ" might help identify the correct item. Let me check the features of this node to see if it matches the query.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B0007XWHVK, title]
Observation 15: The title feature of B0007XWHVK are: Essence (1-year).
