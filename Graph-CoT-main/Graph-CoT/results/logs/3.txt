Question: What brand does the item Intermatic ML900TW 900-Watt Power Pack with Timer and Ground Shield belong to?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What brand does the item Intermatic ML900TW 900-Watt Power Pack with Timer and Ground Shield belong to? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the brand of a specific item node (Intermatic ML900TW 900-Watt Power Pack with Timer and Ground Shield). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Intermatic ML900TW 900-Watt Power Pack with Timer and Ground Shield]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_441.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_441" as the node ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests that the retrieval might have found a brand node instead of the intended item node. I should try to retrieve the item node again, perhaps with a more precise or alternative query.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Intermatic ML900TW 900-Watt Power Pack with Timer and Ground Shield item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_441.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node (brand_441) instead of the item node. This might indicate that the item title is similar to a brand name, or there's an issue with the retrieval. Since the question is about finding the brand of an item, and we have a brand node ID, perhaps I can work backwards. Let me check what items are linked to this brand node to see if the item in question is among them.
Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_441, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_441 are: ['B00007AXBE', 'B00007AXX0', 'B000087KZS']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now I have three item nodes linked to brand_441. I need to check which of these corresponds to the item "Intermatic ML900TW 900-Watt Power Pack with Timer and Ground Shield". I should check the title feature of each item node to identify the correct one.
Action 4: NodeFeature[B00007AXBE, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00007AXBE are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature returned HTML code instead of the actual title text. This suggests that the feature might contain formatted content. I should try to retrieve the title feature for the other item nodes to see if I can find the correct item. Let me try the next item node.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00007AXX0, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00007AXX0 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: Both item nodes B00007AXBE and B00007AXX0 are returning HTML code instead of plain text titles. Let me try the third item node to see if it contains the correct title.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B000087KZS, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B000087KZS are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 7: Thought 7: All three item nodes are returning HTML code instead of plain text titles. This suggests that the title feature might contain formatted content. Since I need to identify which item corresponds to the specific product mentioned in the question, I should check other features like description or category that might help identify the correct item. Alternatively, I could try to retrieve the brand name directly from the brand node since we already have brand_441.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[brand_441, name]
Observation 7: The name feature of brand_441 are: Time Inc UK Ltd. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The brand name for brand_441 is "Time Inc UK Ltd", but this doesn't match the expected brand for an Intermatic product. The item in question should likely belong to an "Intermatic" brand, not Time Inc UK Ltd. This suggests that the initial retrieval was incorrect - the system retrieved a brand node instead of the item node. I need to find the correct item node for "Intermatic ML900TW 900-Watt Power Pack with Timer and Ground Shield". Let me try a different retrieval approach.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Intermatic ML900TW]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_518.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The retrieval is still returning brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the system might be prioritizing brand matches over item matches. Since the question is about finding the brand of a specific item, I need to find the item node first. Let me try to retrieve with a more specific query that includes "item" or try to use partial matching differently.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[ML900TW]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 10: Thought 10: The retrieval system keeps returning brand nodes instead of item nodes, which is problematic for finding the specific item. Since the question asks for the brand of a particular item, I need to find that item first. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for the item using a more unique part of its name or trying to find items that might be related to Intermatic brand.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[900-Watt Power Pack with Timer and Ground Shield]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000BYTOWA.
Thought 11: Thought 11: Great! Now I have an item node ID (B000BYTOWA) that seems to correspond to the product. Let me verify if this is the correct item by checking its title feature.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B000BYTOWA, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B000BYTOWA are: Backpacking Light. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The title "Backpacking Light" doesn't match the item I'm looking for. This suggests that the retrieval didn't find the correct item. Let me try a different approach. Since the item name contains "Intermatic", which is likely a brand name, I should try to find the Intermatic brand node first, then check its items to find the specific product.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[Intermatic brand]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_781.
Thought 13: Thought 13: Now I have a brand node ID (brand_781) that might correspond to Intermatic. Let me check its name feature to confirm if this is the correct brand.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[brand_781, name]
Observation 13: The name feature of brand_781 are: Igp Limited. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The brand name "Igp Limited" doesn't match "Intermatic". This suggests that brand_781 is not the correct Intermatic brand. Let me try a different approach to find the Intermatic brand. I should try to retrieve the brand node with a more precise query.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Intermatic]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_781.
Thought 15: Thought 15: The retrieval keeps returning brand_781 for "Intermatic", but its name is "Igp Limited", which doesn't match. This suggests that there might not be a brand node specifically named "Intermatic" in the graph. However, the item in question exists and should have a brand. Let me try to find the item node by using a different part of its name or try to search for items that might contain "ML900TW" in their features.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[ML900TW item]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Correct answer: Intermatic
