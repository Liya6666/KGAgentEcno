Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['The Very Best of Robert Palmer', 'Nukleopatra', 'A Little South Of Sanity [2-CD SET]', 'On A Day Like Today', 'Sehnsucht', 'Down to You (2000 Film)']?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['The Very Best of Robert Palmer', 'Nukleopatra', 'A Little South Of Sanity [2-CD SET]', 'On A Day Like Today', 'Sehnsucht', 'Down to You (2000 Film)']? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a recommendation based on a user's item history. To recommend a next item, I should look at patterns in the user's history. Since the items are connected through relationships like also_viewed, also_bought, etc., I can find items that are commonly associated with multiple items in the user's history. I need to retrieve the nodes for each item in the history first.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[The Very Best of Robert Palmer]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_376.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that the retrieved node ID is "brand_376", which is a brand node, but the user's history consists of item titles. This suggests that "The Very Best of Robert Palmer" might be a brand name rather than an item title. I should check the features of this node to confirm.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_376, name]
Observation 2: The name feature of brand_376 are: Wine Advocate/Robert Parker Jr. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieved node for "The Very Best of Robert Palmer" is actually a brand node with name "Wine Advocate/Robert Parker Jr.", which doesn't match the query. This suggests I need to search for item nodes instead of brand nodes. Let me try retrieving the item nodes for each title in the user's history.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[The Very Best of Robert Palmer item]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_376.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes. The issue might be that the retrieval function is matching brand names rather than item titles. Let me try a different approach - I should search for items by their exact titles. Perhaps I need to be more specific in my retrieval queries to ensure I get item nodes.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode["The Very Best of Robert Palmer" item title]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B001IUXBX4.
Thought 5: Thought 5: Good, now I have an item node ID (B001IUXBX4) for "The Very Best of Robert Palmer". I need to retrieve the item nodes for all the items in the user's history to proceed with the recommendation. Let me retrieve the remaining items.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Nukleopatra]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_916.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes. I need to modify my retrieval approach to specifically search for item titles. Let me try using more precise queries that indicate I'm looking for items.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode["Nukleopatra" item title]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0009GIZ0W.
Thought 7: Thought 7: Good, now I have an item node ID for "Nukleopatra" (B0009GIZ0W). I need to continue retrieving item nodes for the remaining items in the user's history. Let me retrieve the next item.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode["A Little South Of Sanity [2-CD SET]" item title]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_332.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes for some queries. This suggests that some titles might be ambiguous or the retrieval function is prioritizing brand matches. Let me try a different approach - I'll retrieve all the items in the user's history first, then verify they are indeed item nodes by checking their features.
Action 8: Thought 8: I need to systematically retrieve all items from the user's history and ensure they are item nodes. Let me continue retrieving the remaining items with explicit "item title" specification.
Observation 8: 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I need to continue retrieving the remaining items from the user's history. Let me retrieve the next item with explicit "item title" specification.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode["On A Day Like Today" item title]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7TM.
Thought 10: Thought 10: Good, I have an item node ID for "On A Day Like Today" (B00005N7TM). I need to continue retrieving the remaining items from the user's history. Let me retrieve the next item.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode["Sehnsucht" item title]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 11: Thought 11: Good, I have an item node ID for "Sehnsucht" (B00007J82Z). I need to retrieve the last item from the user's history.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode["Down to You (2000 Film)" item title]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KIH9.
Thought 12: Thought 12: Now I have retrieved all item nodes from the user's history. Let me verify they are indeed item nodes by checking their features. The item nodes are:
Action 12: Thought 12: Now I have retrieved all item nodes from the user's history. Let me verify they are indeed item nodes by checking their features. The item nodes are:
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Thought 13: Now I have retrieved all item nodes from the user's history. Let me verify they are indeed item nodes by checking their features. The item nodes are:
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B001IUXBX4, title]
Observation 13: The title feature of B001IUXBX4 are: 1982 November Playboy Magazine. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: There seems to be a mismatch - the retrieved item node for "The Very Best of Robert Palmer" has title "1982 November Playboy Magazine", which doesn't match the query. This suggests the retrieval might not be working correctly. Let me try a different approach - I'll retrieve nodes using the exact titles from the user's history without additional qualifiers.
Action 14: Thought 14: I'm having issues with the retrieval function not returning the correct items. Let me try retrieving the nodes using just the exact titles from the user's history without any additional qualifiers like "item title". The graph definition states that item nodes have "title" features, so I should be able to retrieve them directly.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I need to reconsider my approach. The retrieval function seems to be matching based on keywords rather than exact titles. Let me try retrieving each item from the user's history one by one using just the exact title as provided in the list.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[The Very Best of Robert Palmer]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_376.
