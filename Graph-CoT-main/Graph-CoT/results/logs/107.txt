Question: Find the items which are in the same brand and same category as item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary".
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Find the items which are in the same brand and same category as item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for items that share both the same brand and same category as a specific item. First, I need to identify the target item node. The item title appears to be incomplete or possibly corrupted with HTML tags. I should retrieve the node using the given text as is.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the item node ID (B00005N7NQ), I need to determine its brand and category. The brand can be found by checking its brand neighbors, and the category is one of its features.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 2: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I have the brand ID (brand_0). Now I need to find the category of the item B00005N7NQ to use as a filter.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 3: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have the brand (brand_0) and categories of the target item. Now I need to find all items that belong to brand_0 and share at least one category with B00005N7NQ. First, I should get all items that belong to brand_0.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[brand_0, item]
Observation 4: The item neighbors of brand_0 are: ['B00005N7NQ']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: Observation 4 shows that brand_0 only has one item neighbor, which is the target item B00005N7NQ itself. This means there are no other items with the same brand as the target item. Therefore, there cannot be any items that share both the same brand and same category as the target item.
Action 5: Thought 5: Since brand_0 only has one item (the target item itself), there are no other items with the same brand. Therefore, no items can satisfy both conditions of having the same brand AND same category as the target item.
Observation 5: 
Thought 6: Thought 6: Based on the observations, brand_0 only has one item (B00005N7NQ), so there are no other items with the same brand as the target item. Therefore, there are no items that share both the same brand and same category as the target item.
Action 6: Action 6: Finish[No other items found. The brand "brand_0" only has one item: "B00005N7NQ".]
Observation 6: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
