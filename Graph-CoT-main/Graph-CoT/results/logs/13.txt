Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?"). This looks like HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to find the correct item node first. Since the title is unclear, I should try to retrieve the node using the partial text that might be meaningful.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[a-size-medium a-color-secondary]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I retrieved a node using the partial text, but I should verify if this is indeed the correct item node by checking its title feature. The question asks for the price, but I need to make sure I have the right item first.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 2: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The node I retrieved does have a title that matches the partial text from the question. However, this appears to be an HTML fragment rather than a proper product title. This might be a data quality issue in the graph. Since I have confirmed this is the correct node (based on the title matching the query), I can now proceed to retrieve the price information as requested.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, price]
Observation 3: The price feature of B00005N7NQ are: . 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The price feature appears to be empty or missing for this node. This could be due to incomplete data in the graph. I should check if there are any other features that might contain price information, or verify if this is indeed the correct item node by checking its category or description features to better understand what this item represents.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 4: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The category suggests this is a magazine subscription rather than a physical product, which might explain why the price is empty - subscription prices might be handled differently. However, the question specifically asks for the price. I should check if there are any other related items or if this node has connections that might provide price information. Let me check the description feature to get more context about this item.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 5: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The description confirms this is a magazine subscription called "REASON". Since the price feature is empty, I should check if there are any related items (like also_viewed or also_bought items) that might have price information, or if this item has a brand connection that could provide pricing details. Let me first check the brand of this item to see if that provides any useful information.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 6: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I have the brand node ID (brand_0) for this item. Let me check the brand name to get more context about this magazine subscription.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 7: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: Now I have confirmed this is a "Reason Magazine" subscription item. Since the price feature is empty in the graph, I need to consider alternative approaches. The question specifically asks for the price, so I should check if there are any related items (like also_viewed, also_bought, or bought_together items) that might be similar products with price information. Let me check the also_viewed items first to see if there are comparable items with prices.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 8: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I have a list of also_viewed items. Since the original item has an empty price field, I should check if any of these related items have price information. They might be similar magazine subscriptions or related products that could give me an indication of the price range. Let me check the price feature of a few of these related items to see if they have price information.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, price]
Observation 9: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 10: Thought 10: The error suggests that B000UHI2LW might not be an item node, or the price feature might not exist for it. Let me first verify what type of node this is by checking its title feature.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 10: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 11: Thought 11: The error suggests that B000UHI2LW might not be a valid node ID in the graph. Let me try to retrieve the node using a different approach. Perhaps I should check if these IDs are indeed item nodes by trying to retrieve one of them directly.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I see the issue now. The IDs returned in the also_viewed_item neighbors list are not all item nodes - B000UHI2LW turned out to be a brand node (brand_756). This means the also_viewed_item relationship might include both items and brands, or there might be an error in the graph structure. Let me check the title feature of the original item again to confirm what we're dealing with, and then try a different approach to find price information.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm still dealing with the same problematic item node with an HTML fragment as its title and no price information. Since the also_viewed_item neighbors include brand nodes (which don't have price features), I should try a different approach. Let me check if this item has any other types of relationships that might lead to items with price information, such as also_bought_item or bought_together_item relationships.
Action 13: Action 13: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 13: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I have a list of also_bought_item neighbors. These should be item nodes that customers bought after viewing the original item. Since the original item has no price, I should check if any of these related items have price information. Let me start by checking the price of the first few items in this list.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B01MCU84LB, price]
Observation 14: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm encountering the same issue where the node ID from the also_bought_item list doesn't seem to be a valid item node when I try to access its price feature. Let me verify what type of node B01MCU84LB is by trying to retrieve it directly.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[B01MCU84LB]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
