Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted with HTML tags ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?"). I need to first retrieve the correct item node using the available title information.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00005N7NQ), I need to get the price feature of this item node.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, price]
Observation 2: The price feature of B00005N7NQ are: . 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The price feature appears to be empty or missing for this node. I should check if I have the correct node by verifying its title feature to ensure this is indeed the item being asked about.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title feature confirms this is the correct node, but the price feature appears to be empty. I should check if there are any alternative item nodes that might have the complete title and price information. Let me search for nodes with similar titles or check if there are related items that might have the price information.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The same node is retrieved with the partial title. Since the price feature appears to be empty for this node, I should check if this item has any related items (like also_viewed, also_bought, etc.) that might have similar titles but complete price information. Let me first check what related items this node has.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 5: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I have a list of also_viewed_item neighbors. I should check if any of these related items have a more complete title that matches the original query, and then check their price features. Let me start by checking the title features of these neighbor nodes to see if any match the original query more closely.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 6: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 7: Thought 7: It seems the feature name might be incorrect or the node might not exist. Let me try checking the title feature for one of the neighbor nodes using the correct feature name "title" (as defined in the graph schema).
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 7: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I notice that the neighbor nodes are being returned as IDs, but when I try to access their features, I'm getting errors. This suggests that either these nodes don't exist in the graph or I need to use a different approach. Let me first verify if the original node has any price information by checking if I'm using the correct feature name. According to the graph definition, item nodes have "price" as a feature. Let me also check what other features this node has to understand the data structure better.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 8: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The description feature exists for this node, confirming that the node is valid. However, the price feature appears to be empty. Let me check if there are other related item connections that might have price information, such as "also_bought_item" or "buy_after_viewing_item" neighbors. I'll start by checking the "also_bought_item" neighbors.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 9: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I have a list of also_bought_item neighbors. Since the original node's price feature appears to be empty, I should check if any of these related items have similar titles that might match the original query more completely, and then check their price features. Let me start by checking the title features of a few of these neighbor nodes to see if any match the pattern from the original query.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B01MCU84LB, title]
Observation 10: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm consistently getting errors when trying to access features of neighbor nodes. This suggests that either these neighbor IDs are not valid item nodes in the graph, or there's an issue with how I'm accessing them. Let me reconsider the problem. The original node B00005N7NQ exists and has features like description, but the price feature appears to be empty. Since the question specifically asks for the price of this item, and the price feature is empty, I should check if there are any other ways to determine the price. Let me first verify what features are available for the original node to ensure I'm not missing something.
Action 11: Thought 11: I'm encountering consistent errors when trying to access features of neighbor nodes. This suggests I need to reconsider my approach. Let me first verify what features are actually available for the original node B00005N7NQ by checking all the defined features for item nodes: title, description, price, img, and category. I've already checked title and description - let me check the remaining features to see if any contain price information or clues.
Observation 11: 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I need to systematically check all available features for the original node B00005N7NQ to see if any contain price information or can help me find the price. Let me check the remaining features: img and category.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, img]
Observation 12: The img feature of B00005N7NQ are: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Iph04Jy3L._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The img feature exists but doesn't contain price information. Let me check the category feature to see if it might contain any relevant information.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 13: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I've checked all available features for the original node B00005N7NQ, and none contain price information. The price feature appears to be empty for this specific item node. Since the question asks for the price of this item, and the price feature is not available in the graph data for this node, I need to conclude that the price information is not available in the current graph database.
Action 14: Thought 15: Based on my investigation, I have determined that the item node B00005N7NQ (with the title "<span class=\"a-size-medium a-color-secondary\"") exists in the graph, but its price feature is empty. I have checked all available features for this node (title, description, img, category) and none contain price information. The price feature specifically returns no value when queried. Since the graph does not contain price information for this particular item, I cannot provide a price value.
