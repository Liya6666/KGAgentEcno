Question: Could you specify the brand of [Aftermarket Product] Black PU Leather Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Flip Case Cover For Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300 Sprint L710 att i747 Verizon i535 T-Mobile T999 New?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Could you specify the brand of [Aftermarket Product] Black PU Leather Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Flip Case Cover For Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300 Sprint L710 att i747 Verizon i535 T-Mobile T999 New? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the brand of an item node with the title "[Aftermarket Product] Black PU Leather Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Flip Case Cover For Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300 Sprint L710 att i747 Verizon i535 T-Mobile T999 New". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[[Aftermarket Product] Black PU Leather Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Flip Case Cover For Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300 Sprint L710 att i747 Verizon i535 T-Mobile T999 New]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_641.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_641" as the node ID, but the question is asking about an item, and the retrieved node ID suggests it might be a brand node rather than an item node. This could be due to the title containing "[Aftermarket Product]" which might be misinterpreted. I should verify the node type by checking its features or neighbors. Since the question is about the brand of an item, I should first confirm if this node is indeed an item node by checking if it has item features like title or price.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_641, title]
Observation 2: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation indicates that "title" is not a valid feature for this node, which suggests that "brand_641" is likely a brand node rather than an item node. This means my initial retrieval might have matched a brand node instead of the intended item node. I should try to retrieve the item node again, perhaps using a more specific or modified query, or check if there's an item node with a similar title.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Black PU Leather Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Flip Case Cover For Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300 Sprint L710 att i747 Verizon i535 T-Mobile T999 New]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00FCJIQQO.
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now I have retrieved an item node with ID B00FCJIQQO. The question is asking for the brand of this item. I need to find the brand neighbor of this item node and then get the brand's name feature.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B00FCJIQQO, brand]
Observation 4: The brand neighbors of B00FCJIQQO are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The observation shows that the item node B00FCJIQQO has no brand neighbors. This is unexpected. I should verify if this is indeed the correct item node by checking its title feature to confirm it matches the question.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00FCJIQQO, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00FCJIQQO are: Safari Garden Wireless Earbuds and built in Mic for Hands Free Calling. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The title of node B00FCJIQQO doesn't match the item in the question. This suggests that my retrieval using a partial title didn't find the correct item. I need to try a different approach to find the exact item node. Perhaps I should try retrieving with the full title but without the "[Aftermarket Product]" prefix, or check if there are other similar items.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Aftermarket Product Black PU Leather Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Flip Case Cover For Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300 Sprint L710 att i747 Verizon i535 T-Mobile T999 New]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00FCJIQQO.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieval is still returning the same incorrect node (B00FCJIQQO) which doesn't match the desired item. I need to try a different strategy. Perhaps the item exists but with a slightly different title. I should try searching for keywords from the title that might be more unique, like "PU Leather Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Flip Case" or check if there are other similar items that might match.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[PU Leather Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Flip Case Cover For Samsung Galaxy S3]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00FCJIQQO.
Thought 8: Thought 8: The retrieval continues to return the same incorrect node (B00FCJIQQO). This suggests that either the exact item doesn't exist in the graph, or it has a different title. Since the question mentions "[Aftermarket Product]" which might not be part of the actual title in the graph, I should try to find items that are keyboard cases for Samsung Galaxy S3 and then check their titles to find the correct one. I can try to find all items related to Samsung Galaxy S3 cases and then filter manually.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Samsung Galaxy S3 Keyboard Case]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The retrieval returned "brand_528" which is a brand node, not an item node. This approach isn't working. I need to try a different strategy. Since the exact title matching isn't working, I should look for items that have "Bluetooth Keyboard" and "Samsung Galaxy S3" in their title by using more specific keywords, or perhaps check the category or description features of existing nodes to find the correct item.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Bluetooth Keyboard Flip Case Cover For Samsung Galaxy S3]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00FCJIQQO.
Thought 10: Thought 10: The retrieval consistently returns the same incorrect node (B00FCJIQQO) which doesn't match the desired item. This suggests that the exact item with the specified title might not exist in the graph, or it might be stored under a different title. Since the question is about finding the brand of this specific item, and I cannot find the exact item node, I should conclude that the item is not in the graph or cannot be found with the given information.
Action 10: Action 10: Finish[The item "[Aftermarket Product] Black PU Leather Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard Flip Case Cover For Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300 Sprint L710 att i747 Verizon i535 T-Mobile T999 New" could not be found in the graph with the exact or similar title. Therefore, the brand information is not available.]
Observation 10: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Best Match
