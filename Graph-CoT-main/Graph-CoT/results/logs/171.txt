Question: What is the exact matched item given this query: 30 gallon fish tank stand?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the exact matched item given this query: 30 gallon fish tank stand? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for an exact match to the query "30 gallon fish tank stand". This suggests I need to search for an item node whose title exactly matches this query. I should use RetrieveNode with the exact query string.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[30 gallon fish tank stand]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_858.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned a brand node (brand_858) instead of an item node. This is unexpected since the query appears to be for an item. I should verify if this is indeed a brand node and then reconsider my approach. Perhaps I need to search for items with this phrase in their title using a different method, or check if there's an item linked to this brand that matches the query.
Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_858, name]
Observation 2: The name feature of brand_858 are: South Florida Sport Fishing. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The brand name "South Florida Sport Fishing" doesn't match the query "30 gallon fish tank stand" at all. This suggests that RetrieveNode may have found a partial match or there's an issue with the exact string matching. Since the question asks for an "exact matched item," I should try to find item nodes that might contain this exact phrase in their title. Perhaps I need to search for items more broadly and then check their titles for an exact match.
Action 3: Thought 3: Since RetrieveNode didn't return the expected item node, I need to approach this differently. The query "30 gallon fish tank stand" likely appears in an item's title. I should search for items that might contain these keywords and then check their titles for an exact match. Let me try retrieving nodes with partial keywords from the query.
Observation 3: 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Since RetrieveNode with the exact query didn't return an item node, I need to try a different approach. I should search for items that contain key terms from the query like "30 gallon", "fish tank", or "stand" and then examine their titles to find an exact match. Let me start by searching for "30 gallon fish tank".
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[30 gallon fish tank]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_858.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm still getting brand_858 when searching for "30 gallon fish tank". This suggests that the RetrieveNode function might be matching keywords rather than exact titles. Since the question specifically asks for an "exact matched item," I need to find a way to search through item titles. Perhaps I should try searching for just "fish tank stand" or look for items that might be related to this category and then check their titles individually.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[fish tank stand]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_858.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently getting brand_858 when searching for various parts of the query. This suggests that the RetrieveNode function might be prioritizing brand matches or there's a limitation in how it handles exact string matching. Since the question asks for an "exact matched item," I need to approach this differently. Perhaps I should look for items that are linked to this brand and then check their titles for an exact match to "30 gallon fish tank stand."
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[brand_858, item]
Observation 6: The item neighbors of brand_858 are: ['B00AF2OFM2']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: Now I have an item node ID (B00AF2OFM2) linked to brand_858. I should check the title feature of this item to see if it exactly matches "30 gallon fish tank stand".
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00AF2OFM2, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B00AF2OFM2 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The title feature returned appears to be HTML code rather than the actual title text. This suggests there might be an issue with how the title is stored or retrieved. I need to try a different approach to get the actual title text. Perhaps I should check if there are other features like "description" that might contain the product name, or try to find other items that might match the query.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00AF2OFM2, description]
Observation 8: The description feature of B00AF2OFM2 are: ['Florida Sport Fishing is a cutting edge approach to hooking up sport fishing and boating related businesses with the millions of resident and visiting anglers enjoying our natural resources. As a small family owned and operated business, our mission is to impact the state?s angling community with the most comprehensive sport fishing publication to date, supported by an innovative online directory - all brought to you by genuine enthusiasts dedicated to making each and every one of your fishing trips as safe and as successful as possible.']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The description confirms this is related to sport fishing, not a fish tank stand. This item clearly doesn't match the query "30 gallon fish tank stand". Since RetrieveNode keeps returning brand_858 for various keyword searches, I need to try a different approach. Perhaps I should search for more specific terms or try to find items in related categories. Let me try searching for "aquarium stand" or "fish tank" to find relevant items.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[aquarium stand]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_858.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm consistently getting brand_858 for all my searches, which suggests that the RetrieveNode function might have limitations in finding exact item matches. Since the question specifically asks for an "exact matched item" to "30 gallon fish tank stand," I need to try a different strategy. Perhaps I should search for individual keywords like "tank" or "stand" to find potential item nodes, then check their titles for an exact match.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[tank]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000066T0T.
Thought 11: Thought 11: Finally, I got a different node ID (B000066T0T) when searching for "tank". This appears to be an item node (starting with B0). I should check its title to see if it matches the query "30 gallon fish tank stand".
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B000066T0T, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B000066T0T are: Military Vehicles (1-year). 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The title "Military Vehicles (1-year)" doesn't match "30 gallon fish tank stand" at all. This suggests that searching for individual keywords might not be effective for finding the exact match. Since the question specifically asks for an "exact matched item," I need to reconsider my approach. Perhaps I should look for items that might be in a related category and then check their titles. Let me try searching for "fish tank" or "aquarium" to find more relevant items.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[fish tank]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_858.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm still getting brand_858 when searching for "fish tank". This suggests that the RetrieveNode function might be biased toward this particular brand node. Since I need to find an exact match for "30 gallon fish tank stand," I should try a different approach. Perhaps I should search for the complete phrase with different formatting or try to find items through their category features. Let me try searching for "30-gallon" or "30 gallon aquarium" to see if I get different results.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[30 gallon aquarium]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_858.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently getting brand_858 for most searches, which suggests this brand might be heavily indexed or there's a limitation in the RetrieveNode function. Since I need to find an exact match for "30 gallon fish tank stand," I should try a different strategy. Perhaps I should search for items that might be related through their category or look for items with "stand" in the title. Let me try searching for "stand" alone to see if I can find relevant items.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[stand]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_22.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I got a different brand node (brand_22) when searching for "stand". Let me check its name and then look for items linked to this brand to see if any match the query.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[brand_22, name]
Observation 15: The name feature of brand_22 are: Outside.
