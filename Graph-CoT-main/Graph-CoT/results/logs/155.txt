Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"']?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"']? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a recommendation based on a user's history, but the history provided appears to be HTML span elements rather than actual item titles or IDs. I need to first understand what these span elements represent - they might be item titles or descriptions that need to be parsed to identify the actual items in the graph.
Action 1: Thought 1: The user's history contains HTML span elements with class attributes, but these don't directly correspond to item titles or IDs in the graph. I need to extract the actual content within these span elements to identify the items. The class "a-size-medium a-color-secondary" suggests these might be from Amazon-style product listings, but the actual text content (the item names) is missing from the provided history.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: The user's history appears to be incomplete - only HTML tags are provided without the actual text content that would identify the items. I cannot retrieve specific items from the graph without knowing what products these span elements contain. I need to either request the actual item titles or make an assumption about how to proceed. Since this is a graph-based recommendation system, I should look for patterns in the graph that could help with recommendations generally.
Action 2: Thought 2: Since the user's history contains only HTML tags without the actual item content, I cannot directly identify specific items in the graph. However, I can try to understand the recommendation logic based on typical graph-based recommendation approaches. In e-commerce graphs, recommendations are often based on relationships like "also_viewed", "also_bought", or "bought_together". I should examine the graph structure to understand how items are connected and what might be a reasonable recommendation strategy.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: Since the user's history contains only HTML tags without actual item identifiers, I cannot retrieve specific items from the graph. However, I can demonstrate the general recommendation approach that would be used if the items were known. Typically, recommendation systems use relationships like "also_bought" or "also_viewed" to suggest items. I should explain this process and note that without actual item titles, I cannot provide a specific recommendation.
Action 3: Thought 1: The user's history contains HTML span elements with class attributes but no actual text content that would identify specific items in the graph. The class "a-size-medium a-color-secondary" suggests these might be from product listings, but without the actual product names or IDs, I cannot retrieve the corresponding item nodes from the graph. I need to either request the actual item titles or explain the recommendation process that would be used if the items were known.
