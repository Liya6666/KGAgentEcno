Question: How many co-viewed items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many co-viewed items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of co-viewed items for a specific item. The term "co-viewed" likely refers to "also_viewed_item" relationships in the graph. However, the item name appears to be incomplete or malformed - it looks like HTML/CSS classes rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the correct node using the given string.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have the node ID B00005N7NQ. The question asks for the number of co-viewed items, which corresponds to "also_viewed_item" neighbors. I should use NodeDegree to count these neighbors.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 24. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The question asks me to provide the answer using node main features (names) rather than node IDs. While I have the count (24), I need to get the actual names of these co-viewed items. I should retrieve the list of also_viewed_item neighbors and then get their titles.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have the list of 24 also_viewed_item node IDs. Now I need to get the main feature (title) for each of these item nodes to provide the answer with names rather than IDs. I should retrieve the title feature for each neighbor node.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 4: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I encountered an error when trying to get the title feature for the first neighbor. The error suggests the feature name might not be correct. Looking back at the graph definition, item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. "title" should be correct. Perhaps the issue is that I need to verify the node exists or try a different approach. Let me try retrieving the node first to confirm it exists.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I see the issue now. When I retrieved the node ID "B000UHI2LW", it returned "brand_756", which means this is actually a brand node, not an item node. However, the question is about "co-viewed items" (also_viewed_item relationships), which should connect item nodes to other item nodes. There seems to be an inconsistency in the graph data. Let me check what type of node B00005N7NQ is first.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[B00005N7NQ]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I see the problem now. Both the original node (B00005N7NQ) and its supposed "also_viewed_item" neighbors are actually brand nodes, not item nodes. This contradicts the graph definition which states that "also_viewed_item" relationships should connect item nodes to other item nodes. There appears to be an inconsistency in the graph data. Since the question specifically asks about "co-viewed items" and expects item names, but the graph contains brand nodes in these relationships, I cannot provide the requested answer with item names. The best I can do is provide the count of also_viewed_item neighbors as requested in the first part of the question.
Action 7: Action 7: Finish[24]
Observation 7: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 30
