Question: How much does the item A genealogy of the descendants of Joseph Bixby, 1621-1701 of Ipswich and Boxford, Massachusetts, who spell the name Bixby, Bigsby, Byxbie, Bixbee, or ... Bekesby, 1427, of Thorpe Morieux, Suffolk cost?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How much does the item A genealogy of the descendants of Joseph Bixby, 1621-1701 of Ipswich and Boxford, Massachusetts, who spell the name Bixby, Bigsby, Byxbie, Bixbee, or ... Bekesby, 1427, of Thorpe Morieux, Suffolk cost? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of a specific item with a long title. I need to find this item node in the graph first.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[A genealogy of the descendants of Joseph Bixby, 1621-1701 of Ipswich and Boxford, Massachusetts, who spell the name Bixby, Bigsby, Byxbie, Bixbee, or ... Bekesby, 1427, of Thorpe Morieux, Suffolk]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0006HANO0.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B0006HANO0), I need to get the price feature of this item node to answer the question.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B0006HANO0, price]
Observation 2: The price feature of B0006HANO0 are: . 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The price feature seems to be empty or not available for this node. I should check if I have the correct node by verifying its title feature to ensure it matches the question.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B0006HANO0, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B0006HANO0 are: Evertons Genealogical Helper. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieved node's title "Evertons Genealogical Helper" doesn't match the full item title from the question. This suggests that the initial retrieval might not have found the exact node. I should try to retrieve the node again with a more specific or partial match of the title, or check if there are other nodes that might match this long title.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Joseph Bixby genealogy]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_144.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval for "Joseph Bixby genealogy" returned a brand node (brand_144) instead of an item node. This is not what I need. I should try to retrieve the node using a different part of the long title or check if the node exists with the exact title. Since the exact title retrieval didn't work, I might need to look for nodes that have "Bixby" in their title or description to find the correct item.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Bixby genealogy]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0006HANO0.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieval for "Bixby genealogy" returns the same node ID B0006HANO0, which has the title "Evertons Genealogical Helper". This doesn't seem to match the full title from the question. I should check the description feature of this node to see if it contains the full title or references to Joseph Bixby.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B0006HANO0, description]
Observation 6: The description feature of B0006HANO0 are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The description is empty. I should try to retrieve the node using a more specific part of the title. Let me try with "Joseph Bixby" to see if there are other relevant nodes.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Joseph Bixby]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_144.
Thought 8: Thought 8: Retrieving "Joseph Bixby" keeps returning a brand node (brand_144), which is not helpful. I should try to retrieve the node using the full title but with proper handling of the ellipsis. Perhaps the exact title in the graph is slightly different. Let me try to retrieve with "A genealogy of the descendants of Joseph Bixby" as a more precise query.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[A genealogy of the descendants of Joseph Bixby]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_144.
Thought 9: Thought 9: This is still returning a brand node. I need to approach this differently. Since the exact title retrieval isn't working, I should check what items are linked to this brand node (brand_144) to see if any of them match the description in the question.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[brand_144, item]
Observation 9: The item neighbors of brand_144 are: ['B00006K33U']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I found that brand_144 has one item neighbor: B00006K33U. This might be the item I'm looking for. I should check the title feature of this item node to see if it matches the question.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00006K33U, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B00006K33U are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The title feature seems to be incomplete or malformed. I should check the description feature of this item node to get more information about it, as it might contain the full title or relevant details.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00006K33U, description]
Observation 11: The description feature of B00006K33U are: ['Covers all aspects of beekeeping information for both hobbyist and professional. Practical, scientific and industry news of honey handling, colony management and the latest in scientific research.']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The description of item B00006K33U is about beekeeping, which doesn't match the genealogy topic from the question. This suggests this is not the correct item. I need to try a different approach. Let me search for nodes that might contain "Bixby" in their title or description using a broader search term.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[Bixby]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_221.
Thought 13: Thought 13: The retrieval for "Bixby" returns a different brand node (brand_221). This isn't helping me find the specific genealogy item. I should try to search for "genealogy" to see if there are relevant items that might include the Bixby genealogy book.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[genealogy]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0006HANO0.
Thought 14: Thought 14: The retrieval for "genealogy" returns the same node B0006HANO0, which we've already seen has the title "Evertons Genealogical Helper". This still doesn't match the specific Bixby genealogy item from the question. Let me try to search for "Bixby genealogy" again but this time check if there are other nodes that might be related by exploring the neighbors of this node or looking for similar items.
Action 14: Action 14: NeighbourCheck[B0006HANO0, also_viewed_item]
Observation 14: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B0006HANO0 are: []. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The also_viewed_item neighbors are empty for B0006HANO0. Let me try to search for the full title with a different approach. Since the exact title is long, perhaps the graph has it stored with a different format or abbreviation. I should try to retrieve the node using the most unique part of the title: "Joseph Bixby, 1621-1701".
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Joseph Bixby, 1621-1701]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_239.
Correct answer: 32.18
