Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"']?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"', '<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"']? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a recommendation based on a user's history, but the history provided appears to be HTML span elements rather than actual item identifiers. I need to clarify what these elements represent or find a way to map them to actual items in the graph. Since these are not standard item titles or IDs, I should first try to retrieve nodes using the provided text to see if they correspond to any items in the graph.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The retrieval returned a node ID for the HTML span text, which suggests that this text might be part of an item's feature (possibly from the description or title). However, the user history contains multiple identical span elements, which is unusual. I should check the features of this node to understand what item it represents and verify if the span text is indeed part of its data.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 2: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The node B00005N7NQ has a title that exactly matches the HTML span text from the user's history. This suggests that the user's history consists of items with HTML-formatted titles. Since there are five identical entries in the history, I need to understand if these represent the same item viewed multiple times or if there are multiple items with the same title format. I should check if this node has any also_viewed_item or also_bought_item neighbors to get recommendation candidates.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have a list of also_viewed_item neighbors for node B00005N7NQ. To provide a recommendation, I should select one of these items and return its title (main feature) rather than the node ID. Since the user has viewed the same item multiple times (based on the identical entries in the history), a common recommendation approach would be to suggest items that are frequently viewed together with this item. I should check the features of one of these neighbor nodes to get its title for the recommendation.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 4: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The feature name "title" might not be correct for this graph. Based on the graph definition, item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Let me try using "title" as the feature key again, but first I should verify if the node B000UHI2LW exists and what features it has. I'll try retrieving the node first to confirm its existence.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieval returned a brand node (brand_756) instead of an item node when I used the ID B000UHI2LW. This suggests that the also_viewed_item neighbors might be returning a mix of item and brand nodes, or there might be an issue with the node IDs. Let me check what type of node B000UHI2LW is by examining its features. Since it's a brand node, it should have a "name" feature rather than "title".
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[brand_756, name]
Observation 6: The name feature of brand_756 are: TWOBIU. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I see that the also_viewed_item neighbor B000UHI2LW is actually a brand node (TWOBIU), not an item node. This is unexpected since the graph definition states that item nodes are linked to also_viewed_item nodes, which should be other item nodes. Let me check the node type of B00005N7NQ to confirm it's an item node, and then re-examine the also_viewed_item neighbors to find actual item nodes for recommendation.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 7: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The node B00005N7NQ is indeed an item node (it has a category feature). However, the also_viewed_item neighbors seem to include brand nodes, which contradicts the graph definition. Let me check the node type of one of the other neighbors to understand this better. I'll try checking if B002PXW18E is an item or brand node.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B002PXW18E, category]
Observation 8: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The feature "category" doesn't exist for node B002PXW18E, suggesting it might be a brand node rather than an item node. Let me try checking if it has a "name" feature instead, which would confirm it's a brand node.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B002PXW18E, name]
Observation 9: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm encountering issues with the node features. Let me try a different approach. Since the user's history contains multiple identical entries of the same HTML span text, and I've found that this corresponds to item node B00005N7NQ, I should focus on this single item for recommendations. Let me check what type of neighbors this item has using the NeighbourCheck function with different neighbor types to find appropriate recommendation candidates.
Action 10: Action 10: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_bought_item]
Observation 10: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B01MCU84LB', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B001THPA26', 'B002CT515Q', 'B00XZF1JUM', 'B0058EONOM', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B079JCLNZ4', 'B00005NIOH', 'B00005N7SD', '0345816021', 'B00006KX3K', 'B0047VIALE', 'B00007AZRH', '0465058728', 'B00FP59VGY', 'B002BFZ9NA', 'B01F2MKW0I', '0415922224', 'B00005N7R5', 'B00005N7PT', 'B002PXW0M6', 'B002PXVYGO', '1548650218', 'B01FIR6AJ4', 'B003I7HS3Y', '1491904224', 'B001TP73UU', '0062308270', 'B06XWC6PRS', 'B002PXVYBE', 'B004GVZUUY', 'B000063XJR', '0465060730', 'B002PXW24C', 'B002CT51A6', '0061479012', 'B001U5SPLK']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: I have a list of also_bought_item neighbors for node B00005N7NQ. These should be item nodes that customers frequently bought together with this item. To provide a recommendation, I should select one of these items and return its title. Let me try checking the title feature of one of these neighbor nodes, starting with the first one in the list.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B01MCU84LB, title]
Observation 11: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm consistently getting errors when trying to access the "title" feature of these nodes. Let me try a different approach. Since the graph definition states that item nodes have title features, perhaps these neighbor nodes are not item nodes, or there might be an issue with the feature name. Let me first verify if B01MCU84LB exists in the graph and what type of node it is by trying to retrieve it directly.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[B01MCU84LB]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I see that B01MCU84LB is actually a brand node (brand_411), not an item node. This suggests that the also_bought_item neighbors might be returning brand nodes instead of item nodes, which contradicts the graph definition. Let me try checking the node type of B00005N7NQ again to confirm it's an item node, and then try a different neighbor type that might give me actual item nodes for recommendation.
Action 13: Thought 13: I'm facing inconsistencies with the graph structure - the neighbor relationships seem to be returning brand nodes instead of item nodes as defined. Let me try checking the bought_together_item neighbors, which should also be item nodes according to the definition. If that doesn't work, I'll need to reconsider my approach.
Observation 13: 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm encountering inconsistencies where neighbor relationships that should return item nodes are instead returning brand nodes. Let me try checking the bought_together_item neighbors for B00005N7NQ, as this might provide actual item nodes for recommendation.
Action 14: Action 14: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, bought_together_item]
Observation 14: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: []. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The bought_together_item neighbors list is empty. Let me try checking the buy_after_viewing_item neighbors, which might provide better recommendation candidates.
Action 15: Action 15: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 15: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: [].
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
