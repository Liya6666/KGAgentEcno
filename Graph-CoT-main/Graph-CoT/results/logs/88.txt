Question: Search for other items under the same brand and category as Dr. King's Natural Medicine Multi-Strain Flu Relief, 2 Fluid Ounce.
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Search for other items under the same brand and category as Dr. King's Natural Medicine Multi-Strain Flu Relief, 2 Fluid Ounce. Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for other items under the same brand and category as "Dr. King's Natural Medicine Multi-Strain Flu Relief, 2 Fluid Ounce". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Dr. King's Natural Medicine Multi-Strain Flu Relief, 2 Fluid Ounce]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7RP.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the brand and category of this item. The brand can be found by checking the brand neighbor, and the category is a feature of the item node itself.
Action 2: Thought 2: To find items under the same brand and category, I first need to determine the brand and category of the given item. I'll check the brand neighbor and the category feature of node B00005N7RP.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to get both the brand and category information for the item. Let me first check the brand neighbor to find the brand node, and then check the category feature of the item.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7RP, brand]
Observation 3: The brand neighbors of B00005N7RP are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The observation shows that there are no brand neighbors for this item. This might indicate that the brand information is missing or that I need to check the brand feature differently. However, according to the graph definition, item nodes are linked to their brand nodes. Let me try to check if there's a brand feature directly on the item node, or perhaps I need to use a different approach. Alternatively, I should check the category feature first.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7RP, category]
Observation 4: The category feature of B00005N7RP are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: Both the brand neighbor and category feature returned empty results for this item. This suggests that the item node might not have complete information in the graph. However, the question asks for items under the same brand and category, so I need to find alternative ways to determine these attributes. Perhaps I should check other features of the item, like the title or description, to infer the brand or category, but the graph functions don't provide direct ways to extract that without predefined links or features. Since the brand neighbor and category feature are empty, there might be no other items under the same brand and category in the graph, or I need to consider that the brand and category are not available for this item. Given the constraints, I should conclude that there are no other items under the same brand and category for this item.
Action 5: Action 5: Finish[No other items found under the same brand and category as the given item, as both brand and category information is missing for node B00005N7RP.]
Observation 5: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Dr. King's Natural Medicine Nosebleed Relief, 2 Fluid Ounce, Dr. King's Natural Medicine Lungs and Bronchial Relief, 2 Fluid Ounce
