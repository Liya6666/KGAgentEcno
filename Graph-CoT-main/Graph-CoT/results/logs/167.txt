Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['Almost Like a Song', 'The Three of Us: Growing Up with Tammy and George', 'Sony TCM-210DV Standard Cassette Voice Recorder', 'Camco 40431 Roof Vent Cover (White)', 'Golf cart driving enclosure 2 seater', "Birkenstock Sandals ''Florida'' from Leather in blue with a regular insole"]?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What next item should be recommended to the user based on his history: ['Almost Like a Song', 'The Three of Us: Growing Up with Tammy and George', 'Sony TCM-210DV Standard Cassette Voice Recorder', 'Camco 40431 Roof Vent Cover (White)', 'Golf cart driving enclosure 2 seater', "Birkenstock Sandals ''Florida'' from Leather in blue with a regular insole"]? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a next item recommendation based on a user's history of items. The history contains several item titles. To recommend a next item, I should look at the relationships between these items and other items in the graph, such as "also_bought_item" or "bought_together_item". A common strategy is to find items that are frequently bought together with the items in the user's history. I should first retrieve the node IDs for all the items in the user's history list.

Action 4: Action 1: RetrieveNode[Almost Like a Song]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_708.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I notice that retrieving "Almost Like a Song" returned a brand node (brand_708) instead of an item node. This suggests that "Almost Like a Song" might be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me try retrieving the other items from the user's history to find their corresponding nodes.
