Question: Which object is co-viewed more than 4 times with the object Cleo's Counting Book (Cleo Series)?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which object is co-viewed more than 4 times with the object Cleo's Counting Book (Cleo Series)? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items that are co-viewed (also_viewed_item) with "Cleo's Counting Book (Cleo Series)" more than 4 times. First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[Cleo's Counting Book (Cleo Series)]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006L2Z8.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find all the also_viewed_item neighbors of this item node and check how many times each appears. Since the question asks for items co-viewed more than 4 times, I need to get all also_viewed_item neighbors and then count their occurrences.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00006L2Z8, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00006L2Z8 are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that there are no also_viewed_item neighbors directly linked to this item. However, the question asks about items that are co-viewed more than 4 times, which might imply a different interpretation. Perhaps "co-viewed" refers to items that are commonly viewed together across multiple users, and I need to look at the frequency of co-viewing relationships. But based on the graph definition, items are linked to also_viewed_item nodes directly. Since there are no neighbors, maybe this item has no also_viewed items, or I need to consider a different approach.
Action 3: Thought 3: Since the direct NeighbourCheck returned an empty list for also_viewed_item, perhaps I need to consider that "co-viewed more than 4 times" might refer to items that have multiple connections through the also_viewed_item relationship. However, the observation shows no direct connections. Maybe I should check if there are other types of relationships or if I need to look at the broader network. Alternatively, perhaps the item has also_viewed_item neighbors, but they are not directly linked in this way. Let me try to check the node degree for also_viewed_item to confirm.
Observation 3: 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Since the direct NeighbourCheck returned an empty list, I should verify this by checking the node degree for also_viewed_item neighbors to confirm if there are indeed no connections.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeDegree[B00006L2Z8, also_viewed_item]
Observation 4: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00006L2Z8 are: 0. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The node degree confirms that there are no also_viewed_item neighbors for this item. However, the question asks for items co-viewed more than 4 times, which might be interpreted differently. Perhaps "co-viewed" refers to items that are viewed together in sessions, and I need to look at the frequency across the graph. But based on the available functions and graph definition, the also_viewed_item relationship is direct between items. Since there are no such neighbors, there might be no items co-viewed with this one, or the question might have a different meaning. Alternatively, I should consider if "co-viewed" could be represented by other relationships like buy_after_viewing or also_bought, but the question specifically says "co-viewed," which typically corresponds to also_viewed_item. Given that the degree is 0, there are no items co-viewed with this one, so no items meet the "more than 4 times" criterion. Therefore, the answer should be that there are no such items.
Action 5: Thought 5: Since there are no also_viewed_item neighbors for this item, there are no items that are co-viewed with it at all, let alone more than 4 times. Therefore, the answer should be that no items meet this criterion.
Observation 5: 
Thought 6: Action 5: Finish[No items are co-viewed with Cleo's Counting Book (Cleo Series) more than 4 times, as it has no also_viewed_item neighbors.]
Action 6: Finish[No items are co-viewed with Cleo's Counting Book (Cleo Series) more than 4 times, as it has no also_viewed_item neighbors.]
Observation 6: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Cleo and Caspar (Cleo Series), Cleo's Alphabet Book (Barefoot Paperback), Where's the Cat?
