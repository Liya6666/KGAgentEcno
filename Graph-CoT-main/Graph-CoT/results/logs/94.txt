Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the format of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the format of an item with a specific title containing HTML-like text: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"". First, I need to find the item node with this title in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary">]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00005N7NQ), I need to understand what the question means by "format." Since the question asks for the node's main feature rather than IDs, and mentions "names," I should check the item's features. The main features of an item node are title, description, price, img, and category. Given the title contains HTML-like text, the "format" might refer to the category or another attribute that describes the item's type or medium. Let me check the category feature first, as it often indicates the format (e.g., book, DVD, etc.).
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 2: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The category features indicate this is a magazine subscription, specifically in professional/educational journals. However, the question asks for "format" and mentions providing "names" rather than IDs. Since this is an item node, and the title contains HTML-like text, perhaps "format" refers to the actual media format (e.g., digital, physical, subscription). The categories suggest it's a subscription service. Let me check the description feature to get more details about the format.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, description]
Observation 3: The description feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['REASON is edited for people interested in economic, social, and international issues. Viewpoint stresses individual liberty, private responsibility, and limited government. Some emphasis on Pacific Rim, local/state issues with national impact, science/technology. Regular departments include news/trends, book reviews (mostly history, politics, and economics), and cultural commentary.']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The description confirms this is a magazine subscription called "REASON" focusing on economic and social issues. However, the question specifically asks for the "format" of the item. Looking at the category information, the most specific format-related classification appears to be "Magazine Subscriptions." Since the question asks to provide node main features rather than IDs, and mentions "names," I should provide the category name that best describes the format. The most relevant format description from the categories is "Magazine Subscriptions."
Action 4: Action 4: Finish[Magazine Subscriptions]
Observation 4: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: Print Magazine
