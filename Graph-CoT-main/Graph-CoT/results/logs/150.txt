Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the most popular category name of the co-viewed items with Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm .15 Ounces (Pack of 6)? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the most popular category name among the co-viewed items (also_viewed_item neighbors) of the item "Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm .15 Ounces (Pack of 6)". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm .15 Ounces (Pack of 6)]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_407.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I need to correct my approach. The observation shows that the retrieved node ID is "brand_407", but the question is about an item, not a brand. I should retrieve the item node using its full title. Let me try again with the exact item name.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm .15 Ounces (Pack of 6)]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_407.
Thought 3: Thought 3: It seems there might be an issue with the retrieval. The observation returns a brand node ID, but we're looking for an item. Perhaps the item title is slightly different in the graph. Let me try to retrieve the node using a partial keyword match or check if there's a different way to find this item.
Action 3: RetrieveNode[Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_407.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I'm still getting a brand node instead of an item node. This suggests that the exact title might not be matching. Let me try a different approach - perhaps the item has a slightly different title in the graph. Let me try retrieving with just "Banana Boat" to see what items come up, then narrow it down.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[Banana Boat]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_388.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. This suggests that the RetrieveNode function might be prioritizing brand matches over item matches, or the item title might be stored differently. Let me try to be more specific by including more unique identifiers from the title, like "SPF 50" and "Lip Balm".
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Lip Balm]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_407.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve this specific product. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable by its full title, or there might be an issue with how the retrieval function works. Let me try a different strategy - perhaps I can find the item through its brand first. Since I know the brand is "Banana Boat" (from the product name), let me retrieve the brand node and then find its items.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Banana Boat]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_388.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I have the brand node ID (brand_388) for Banana Boat. Now I need to find all items belonging to this brand to locate the specific sunscreen lip balm product. I can use NeighbourCheck to get all items linked to this brand.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[brand_388, item]
Observation 7: The item neighbors of brand_388 are: ['B00006L2EI']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I found one item node (B00006L2EI) for the Banana Boat brand. However, the question is about a specific item "Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm .15 Ounces (Pack of 6)". Let me check the features of this item node to confirm if it's the correct one.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00006L2EI, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B00006L2EI are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than the actual product title. This suggests there might be an issue with how the feature is stored or retrieved. Let me try to get the description or other features to identify this item.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00006L2EI, description]
Observation 9: The description feature of B00006L2EI are: ['Devoted to the building, care, design and use of wooden boats, both large and small, yachts and working vessels, traditional and modern. Emphasis is on craftsmanship and knowledge.']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: This description is about wooden boats, not sunscreen. This suggests that the brand_388 node might not be the correct Banana Boat brand for sunscreen products. Let me try to find the correct Banana Boat brand node. The product in question is sunscreen, so perhaps there's a different brand node for Banana Boat sunscreen products. Let me try to retrieve the brand node with more specific keywords.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Banana Boat Sport]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KRW0.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I got a different node ID (B00006KRW0) when searching for "Banana Boat Sport". This might be an item node rather than a brand node. Let me check its features to confirm what type of node it is and if it's the correct product.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00006KRW0, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B00006KRW0 are: Paddler. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The title "Paddler" doesn't match the sunscreen product I'm looking for. I'm still not finding the correct item. Let me try a different approach. Since the question mentions "Banana Boat Sport SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm", let me try to search for nodes related to sunscreen or SPF to find the correct item.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[SPF 50 Sunscreen Lip Balm]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_407.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable by its full title. Let me try a different strategy. Since I need to find the co-viewed items of this specific product, I should first try to find any Banana Boat sunscreen items in the graph and then check their also_viewed neighbors. Let me search for "Banana Boat sunscreen" to see if I can find relevant items.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Banana Boat sunscreen]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_916.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve items. This suggests that the RetrieveNode function might be prioritizing brand matches over item matches.

Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_407.
