Question: What is the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with Fashion Golden Gray White Pearl Bead Cluster Chain 4 Levels Choker Statement Necklace?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with Fashion Golden Gray White Pearl Bead Cluster Chain 4 Levels Choker Statement Necklace? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with a specific item. First, I need to find the node for "Fashion Golden Gray White Pearl Bead Cluster Chain 4 Levels Choker Statement Necklace" to get its ID.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[Fashion Golden Gray White Pearl Bead Cluster Chain 4 Levels Choker Statement Necklace]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the items that are often viewed together with this item. According to the graph definition, items are linked to "also_viewed_item" nodes. I should get the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for this node.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00007J82Z, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00007J82Z are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that there are no also_viewed_item neighbors for this node. This might be because the item doesn't have any recorded "also viewed" items, or there might be an issue with the node ID. I should verify if I have the correct node by checking its title feature to ensure it matches the query.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B00007J82Z, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00007J82Z are: Sew Beautiful. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title "Sew Beautiful" doesn't match the query "Fashion Golden Gray White Pearl Bead Cluster Chain 4 Levels Choker Statement Necklace". This suggests that the initial node retrieval might have been incorrect. I need to try retrieving the node again with a more specific or accurate query, perhaps using a partial match or different keywords.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Golden Gray White Pearl Bead Cluster Chain 4 Levels Choker Statement Necklace]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval is still returning the same node ID with a different title. This suggests that the graph might not have the exact item mentioned in the question, or the node might be indexed differently. I should try to retrieve the node using a different approach, perhaps by using a more distinctive part of the title or checking if there are any nodes with similar features.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Pearl Bead Cluster Chain Choker Statement Necklace]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieval consistently returns the same node ID (B00007J82Z) with the title "Sew Beautiful", which doesn't match the query. This suggests that either the graph doesn't contain the exact item mentioned, or there might be an issue with how the items are indexed. Since the question asks about items viewed together with this specific necklace, and I cannot find the correct node, I should consider that the typical cost cannot be determined because the item doesn't exist in the graph or has no also_viewed_item neighbors.
Action 6: Thought 6: Since I cannot find the correct node for "Fashion Golden Gray White Pearl Bead Cluster Chain 4 Levels Choker Statement Necklace" in the graph, I should conclude that the item does not exist in the graph or has been incorrectly indexed. Therefore, I cannot determine the typical cost of items viewed together with it.
Observation 6: 
Thought 7: Action 6: Finish[The item "Fashion Golden Gray White Pearl Bead Cluster Chain 4 Levels Choker Statement Necklace" does not exist in the graph, so the typical cost of items viewed together with it cannot be determined.]
Action 7: Finish[The item "Fashion Golden Gray White Pearl Bead Cluster Chain 4 Levels Choker Statement Necklace" does not exist in the graph, so the typical cost of items viewed together with it cannot be determined.]
Observation 7: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 9.95
