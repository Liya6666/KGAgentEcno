Question: Which items from publisher Our Sunday Visitor Inc have the most also-viewed items?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which items from publisher Our Sunday Visitor Inc have the most also-viewed items? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items from a specific publisher (Our Sunday Visitor Inc) and wants to know which of these items have the most also-viewed items. First, I need to find the brand node for "Our Sunday Visitor Inc" since "publisher" likely corresponds to a brand in this context.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Our Sunday Visitor Inc]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_514.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node ID, I need to find all items linked to this brand. Then I'll need to check the number of also_viewed_item neighbors for each of these items to determine which ones have the most.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_514, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_514 are: ['B00007KXVO']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I see that brand_514 has only one item neighbor: 'B00007KXVO'. Since there's only one item from this publisher, it automatically has the most also-viewed items by default. Now I need to get the title/name of this item to answer the question.
Action 3: NodeFeature[B00007KXVO, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00007KXVO are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title feature seems to contain HTML markup. I need to extract the actual title text. Let me try getting the title feature again or check if there's a cleaner way to get the item name.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00007KXVO, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00007KXVO are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The title feature appears to be returning HTML markup rather than clean text. Let me try retrieving the node by its title or check if there's another way to get the item's name. Perhaps I should try using the RetrieveNode function with a more specific query or check other features like description.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[B00007KXVO]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_552.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I seem to be getting confused with node IDs. Let me clarify the situation. I have a brand node (brand_514) with one item neighbor (B00007KXVO). When I tried to get the title of this item, I got HTML markup. Let me try to get the actual item name by checking if B00007KXVO is indeed an item node and try to get its title feature properly.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00007KXVO, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00007KXVO are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm still getting HTML markup instead of a clean title. Let me try a different approach. Since the item node ID is B00007KXVO, which looks like an ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number), perhaps I should try to get the actual title by using the RetrieveNode function with this ID to confirm the node exists, then try to extract the text content from the title feature or check if there's a way to get a cleaner version.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[B00007KXVO]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_552.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm getting inconsistent results. When I retrieve "B00007KXVO" as a node, it's returning a brand node (brand_552) instead of an item node. This suggests that "B00007KXVO" might actually be a brand ID rather than an item ID. Let me go back and check the neighbors of brand_514 again to get the correct item nodes.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[brand_514, item]
Observation 8: The item neighbors of brand_514 are: ['B00007KXVO']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm getting conflicting information. When I check the neighbors of brand_514, it returns ['B00007KXVO'] as an item neighbor, but when I try to retrieve B00007KXVO as a node, it returns brand_552. This suggests there might be an issue with the graph data or my understanding. Let me try to get the title feature directly from the item node using the neighbor information, or check if B00007KXVO is actually an item node by trying to get its features.
Action 9: Thought 9: I need to verify if 'B00007KXVO' is indeed an item node. Let me try to get its category feature, which should confirm if it's an item node (since items have category features but brands don't).
Observation 9: 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I need to verify if 'B00007KXVO' is indeed an item node by checking if it has item-specific features like category. If it's an item node, it should have a category feature.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00007KXVO, category]
Observation 10: The category feature of B00007KXVO are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional &amp; Educational Journals', 'Professional &amp; Trade', 'Education']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: Good, now I've confirmed that B00007KXVO is indeed an item node since it has a category feature. The issue earlier was that when I tried to retrieve "B00007KXVO" as a node, it was returning a brand node, which suggests there might be a naming conflict in the graph. However, since I can access its features as an item node, I should proceed. Now I need to get the actual title/name of this item. Let me try to extract the text content from the title feature more carefully.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00007KXVO, description]
Observation 11: The description feature of B00007KXVO are: ['Learn more about the teachings of the Catholic Faith, in the lively, colorful &amp; easy to read format of the Catholic Answer. The magazine brings orthodox pastoral responses to questions and is packed with inspirational and helpful features to satisfy your curiousity', '', '']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The description feature gives me some information about the item, but I still need the actual title/name. Let me try to get the title feature again and see if I can extract meaningful text from it. Perhaps the HTML markup contains the actual title text within it.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00007KXVO, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B00007KXVO are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The title feature is still returning HTML markup rather than clean text. This suggests that the actual title might be embedded within this HTML. Let me try to see if there's a way to extract the text content, or perhaps check if there's another feature that contains the item's name. Since the question asks for the "main feature" which is typically the title for items, I need to find a way to get the actual title text.
Action 13: Thought 13: Since the title feature is returning HTML markup, I should try to extract the text content from it. Alternatively, I could check if there's a way to get a cleaner version of the title. Let me also verify if this item has any also_viewed_item neighbors, as the question asks about items with the most also-viewed items.
Observation 13: 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I need to first check how many also_viewed_item neighbors this item has, and then find a way to get its proper title. Since there's only one item from this publisher, it will automatically have the most also-viewed items. Let me check the number of also_viewed_item neighbors first.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeDegree[B00007KXVO, also_viewed_item]
Observation 14: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00007KXVO are: 1. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: Now I have confirmed that the item B00007KXVO has 1 also_viewed_item neighbor. Since this is the only item from publisher Our Sunday Visitor Inc, it has the most also-viewed items by default. However, I still need to provide the item's name/title rather than the node ID. The title feature seems to be returning HTML markup. Let me try to see if I can extract meaningful text from the description or try a different approach to get the item's name.
Action 15: Thought 15: Since the title feature is returning HTML markup, I should try to extract the text content from it or look for alternative ways to get the item's name. Let me check if there's a way to get a cleaner version of the title, perhaps by trying to retrieve the node using a different approach or checking if the HTML contains the actual title text.
Observation 15:
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
