Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.

Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Search for other items under the same brand and category as KIM KARDASHIAN GOLD by Kim Kardashian for WOMEN: BODY LOTION 3.4 OZ. Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for other items under the same brand and category as a specific item. First, I need to find the node for "KIM KARDASHIAN GOLD by Kim Kardashian for WOMEN: BODY LOTION 3.4 OZ" to get its brand and category information.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[KIM KARDASHIAN GOLD by Kim Kardashian for WOMEN: BODY LOTION 3.4 OZ]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_407.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned "brand_407" as the ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests that the retrieval might have found a brand node instead of the item node. I should try to retrieve the item node more specifically by using a more precise query or by considering that the item title might be slightly different in the graph.
Action 2: Thought 2: The observation returned a brand node ID (brand_407), but I was looking for an item node. This suggests that the exact title "KIM KARDASHIAN GOLD by Kim Kardashian for WOMEN: BODY LOTION 3.4 OZ" might not match an item node directly, or there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should try to retrieve the item node using a partial match or a different approach. Let me try to retrieve with a shorter keyword from the title.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: Since the initial retrieval returned a brand node instead of the item node, I should try a different approach. Let me try to retrieve the item node using a more specific part of the title, such as "KIM KARDASHIAN GOLD BODY LOTION" or similar. Alternatively, I can consider that the item might be stored under a slightly different name.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[KIM KARDASHIAN GOLD BODY LOTION]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_848.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of the item node. This suggests that the retrieval function might be matching brand names rather than item titles. Let me try a different approach - perhaps the item title is stored differently. I should try to retrieve using a unique part of the title that might be more specific to the item, such as including the size "3.4 OZ".
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[KIM KARDASHIAN GOLD 3.4 OZ]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_57.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of the item node, which suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand matches or the item title might not be stored exactly as given. Let me try a different strategy - perhaps I should look for the brand first and then find items under that brand, but I need the specific item to get its category. Alternatively, I can try to retrieve the item using a more precise query that includes both brand and product type.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[KIM KARDASHIAN GOLD BODY LOTION 3.4 OZ WOMEN]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_407.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently retrieving brand nodes instead of the item node, which suggests that the retrieval function might be matching brand names when the query contains "Kim Kardashian". Let me try a different approach - I should first identify the brand node for "Kim Kardashian" and then find all items under that brand. From there, I can locate the specific item and its category.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Kim Kardashian]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000FBFXD8.
Thought 7: Thought 7: Observation 6 returned "B000FBFXD8" as the ID, which appears to be an item node ID (starting with B). This suggests that there is an item with "Kim Kardashian" in its title. Let me check the features of this node to see if it matches the item we're looking for.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B000FBFXD8, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B000FBFXD8 are: Ok! First Celebrity News. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The item with ID B000FBFXD8 has a title "Ok! First Celebrity News" which doesn't match the item we're looking for. This suggests that retrieving by "Kim Kardashian" alone might not be specific enough. Let me try a more targeted approach to find the exact item. I should try to retrieve the brand node for "Kim Kardashian" first, then find all items under that brand, and then locate the specific body lotion item.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Kim Kardashian brand]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_24.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I retrieved a brand node (brand_24) for "Kim Kardashian brand". Now I need to verify if this is the correct brand for the item in question. Let me check the name of this brand node to confirm.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[brand_24, name]
Observation 9: The name feature of brand_24 are: Trusted Media Brands, Inc. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The brand node brand_24 has the name "Trusted Media Brands, Inc." which doesn't seem to match "Kim Kardashian". This suggests that my retrieval for the brand might be incorrect. Let me try a different approach to find the correct brand node. I should try to retrieve the item node using a more specific query that focuses on the product type rather than the brand name.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[GOLD BODY LOTION 3.4 OZ]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B0007XWHVK.
Thought 11: Thought 11: Great! I finally retrieved an item node (B0007XWHVK) instead of a brand node. Now I need to check if this is the correct item by examining its title feature.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B0007XWHVK, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B0007XWHVK are: Essence (1-year). 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The retrieved item "Essence (1-year)" doesn't match the target item. I need to find the correct item node for "KIM KARDASHIAN GOLD by Kim Kardashian for WOMEN: BODY LOTION 3.4 OZ". Let me try a different approach - I should search for items that have "BODY LOTION" in their title and then filter for those with "Kim Kardashian" in the brand or title.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[BODY LOTION]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_848.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve items. This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand matches over item matches when the query contains common product terms. Let me try a different strategy - I'll first find the brand node for Kim Kardashian by being more specific, then find all items under that brand, and then identify the specific body lotion item.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Kim Kardashian Gold]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00IQENMIE.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I retrieved an item node (B00IQENMIE) with "Kim Kardashian Gold" in the query. Let me check its title to see if it matches the target item.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00IQENMIE, title]
Observation 14: The title feature of B00IQENMIE are: Entertainment Weekly Magazine (1-Year Subscription). 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm still not getting the correct item. This is taking too many steps without progress. Let me try a different approach - I'll assume that the item exists and try to find it by first identifying the brand correctly. Since the item mentions "KIM KARDASHIAN GOLD", let me try to find the brand node for "Kim Kardashian" specifically for fragrances or beauty products.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Kim Kardashian fragrance]
