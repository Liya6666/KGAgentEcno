Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the price of item Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Deck 3 - The Hook Mountain Massacre Adventure? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of a specific item node: "Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Deck 3 - The Hook Mountain Massacre Adventure". I need to first retrieve this node from the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Deck 3 - The Hook Mountain Massacre Adventure]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KWSP.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00006KWSP), I need to get the price feature of this item node.
Action 2: NodeFeature[B00006KWSP, price]
Observation 2: The price feature of B00006KWSP are: . 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The price feature seems to be empty or not available for this node. I should verify if I have the correct node by checking its title feature to ensure the retrieval was accurate.
Action 3: NodeFeature[B00006KWSP, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00006KWSP are: Shamans Drum. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title "Shamans Drum" doesn't match the item I was looking for ("Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Deck 3 - The Hook Mountain Massacre Adventure"). This suggests that the initial retrieval might have been incorrect or there might be multiple nodes with similar names. I should try to retrieve the node again with a more specific query or check if there are other related nodes.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Deck 3 - The Hook Mountain Massacre Adventure]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KWSP.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval is consistently returning the same node ID (B00006KWSP) with a mismatched title. This suggests that the graph might not have an exact match for the full item name. I should try to retrieve the node using a partial keyword or check if there are other related nodes that might match the description.
Action 5: RetrieveNode[Pathfinder Adventure Card Game Rise of the Runelords Deck 3 Hook Mountain Massacre Adventure]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_501.
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieval returned a brand node (brand_501) instead of an item node, which is not what we want. I should try a different approach. Since the item name is long, I should try retrieving with just the most distinctive keywords from the title.
Action 6: RetrieveNode[Hook Mountain Massacre Adventure]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_396.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieval is still returning brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the exact item might not be in the graph, or I need to use a different strategy. Let me try retrieving with "Pathfinder Adventure Card Game" which is the main product line name.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Pathfinder Adventure Card Game]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_501.
Thought 8: Thought 8: The retrieval is consistently returning brand nodes when I try different parts of the item name. This suggests that the exact item might not be in the graph, or I need to approach this differently. Let me try to retrieve the node using the specific product name "The Hook Mountain Massacre Adventure" which seems to be the most distinctive part of the title.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[The Hook Mountain Massacre Adventure]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_396.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the exact item might not be in the graph, or the retrieval function might be matching against brand names rather than item titles. Let me try a different approach - I should look for nodes that might be related to Pathfinder games and then check their features to find the specific item.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Rise of the Runelords Deck 3]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KWSP.
Thought 10: Thought 10: The retrieval returned the same node ID (B00006KWSP) as before, which has the title "Shamans Drum". This doesn't match the Pathfinder item we're looking for. Since the exact item might not be in the graph, I should check if there are any related items that might be the correct one by exploring neighbors of this node or similar items. However, given that the question specifically asks for this item and it doesn't appear to be in the graph, I should conclude that the price information is not available.
Action 10: Finish[The item "Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords Deck 3 - The Hook Mountain Massacre Adventure" does not appear to be in the graph, so its price information is not available.]
Observation 10: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 17.5
