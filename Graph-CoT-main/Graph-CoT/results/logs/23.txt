Question: Can you tell me the cost of Suunto M5 Heart Rate Monitor?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you tell me the cost of Suunto M5 Heart Rate Monitor? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item called "Suunto M5 Heart Rate Monitor". I need to first find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Suunto M5 Heart Rate Monitor]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_607.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned a node ID "brand_607", which appears to be a brand node rather than an item node. The question is asking about an item's price, so I need to find the actual item node. I should try to retrieve the item node more specifically, perhaps by including more details from the item name.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Suunto M5 Heart Rate Monitor item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_855.
Thought 3: Thought 3: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of the item node. This suggests that the item name might not be matching exactly in the graph. I should try to find the item node through the brand connection. Since "Suunto" is likely the brand name, I can first retrieve the brand node and then find its items.
Action 3: RetrieveNode[Suunto]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_385.
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now that I have the Suunto brand node (brand_385), I can find all items associated with this brand to locate the specific "Suunto M5 Heart Rate Monitor" item.
Action 4: NeighbourCheck[brand_385, item]
Observation 4: The item neighbors of brand_385 are: ['B00006KYO9']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: I have one item node ID ['B00006KYO9'] associated with the Suunto brand. However, I need to verify if this is indeed the "Suunto M5 Heart Rate Monitor" item by checking its title feature.
Action 5: NodeFeature[B00006KYO9, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00006KYO9 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The title feature returned HTML code instead of the actual product title. This suggests there might be an issue with how the title is stored or retrieved. I should try to get more information about this item to confirm if it's the correct one. Let me check the description feature which might contain the full product name.
Action 6: NodeFeature[B00006KYO9, description]
Observation 6: The description feature of B00006KYO9 are: ["Supertrax International is one of Canada's leading publications in snowmobiling. The magazine offers reviews, new releases, and product information - all with a Canadian flare.", '', '']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The description doesn't match "Suunto M5 Heart Rate Monitor" at all - it's about a snowmobiling magazine. This suggests that the item node B00006KYO9 is not the correct product. I need to find the actual "Suunto M5 Heart Rate Monitor" item. Let me try a different approach by searching for the specific product name with more precision.
Action 7: RetrieveNode[Suunto M5 Heart Rate Monitor product]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_843.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item directly. Let me try a different strategy - perhaps the item title in the graph might be slightly different. Let me search for just "M5 Heart Rate Monitor" to see if that helps locate the correct item.
Action 8: RetrieveNode[M5 Heart Rate Monitor]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_607.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve items. This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand matches over item matches. Let me try a different approach - I'll search for "Suunto" items more broadly and then examine their features to find the specific M5 model.
Action 9: Thought 9: Since direct retrieval isn't working, I should find all Suunto brand items and then check their titles to identify the M5 Heart Rate Monitor specifically. Let me first get the correct Suunto brand node.
Observation 9: 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I need to find the correct Suunto brand node first. From previous attempts, I got brand_385 and brand_607 when searching for "Suunto". Let me try to get the brand node by a more specific query to ensure I have the right one.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Suunto brand]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_728.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm getting inconsistent brand node IDs when searching for "Suunto" (brand_385, brand_607, brand_728). This suggests there might be multiple brand nodes or the retrieval isn't working as expected. Let me try a different approach - I'll check the features of one of these brand nodes to confirm if it's actually the Suunto brand.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[brand_385, name]
Observation 11: The name feature of brand_385 are: Supertrax. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I see the issue now - brand_385 is actually "Supertrax" not "Suunto". This explains why the item associated with it was a snowmobiling magazine. Let me check the name feature of another brand node I retrieved to find the actual Suunto brand.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[brand_607, name]
Observation 12: The name feature of brand_607 are: Onfitness. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: Neither brand_385 nor brand_607 is the Suunto brand. Let me check brand_728 which I retrieved earlier.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[brand_728, name]
Observation 13: The name feature of brand_728 are: Trusted Media Brands, Inc.. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: None of the brand nodes I've retrieved so far are actually the Suunto brand. I need to find the correct Suunto brand node. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for "Suunto" as part of the item title might help me locate the correct item directly, or I might need to try more specific queries.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Suunto M5]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007GAMH.
Thought 15: Thought 15: Great! I finally got an item node ID (B00007GAMH) instead of a brand node. This suggests that "Suunto M5" successfully retrieved the correct item. Now I need to verify that this is indeed the "Suunto M5 Heart Rate Monitor" by checking its title feature, and then get its price.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00007GAMH, title]
Observation 15: The title feature of B00007GAMH are: Moto Kids.
Correct answer: 188.99
