Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the price of item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?"). This looks like HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to find a way to identify the correct item node despite this incomplete information.
Action 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item, but the item title appears to be incomplete or corrupted ("<span class=\"a-size-medium a-color-secondary\"?"). This looks like HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to find a way to identify the correct item node despite this incomplete information.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: Since the item title appears to be corrupted HTML code, I cannot directly retrieve the node using this string. I need to find an alternative approach. Perhaps I should look for items that might have this HTML fragment in their title or description features, or maybe this is a placeholder for a specific item that needs to be identified differently.
Action 2: Thought 2: The corrupted HTML in the item title suggests this might be a parsing error or the actual item title might contain this HTML fragment. I should try to retrieve nodes that might match this partial string, or look for items that have similar HTML patterns in their features.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The HTML fragment "<span class=\"a-size-medium a-color-secondary\"?" appears to be part of an HTML element that might be used for styling text. This could be embedded in the title or description of an item. I should try to retrieve nodes that contain this specific string in their title feature.
Action 3: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I successfully retrieved a node with ID B00005N7NQ using the HTML fragment. Now I need to verify that this is indeed an item node and then check its price feature as requested.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, price]
Observation 4: The price feature of B00005N7NQ are: . 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The price feature appears to be empty or missing for this node. I should verify that this is indeed an item node and check its other features to confirm it's the correct item. Let me check the title feature to see if it matches the HTML fragment we used for retrieval.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The title feature confirms this node has the exact HTML fragment we used for retrieval. However, this appears to be an incomplete or malformed title that contains HTML code rather than a proper product name. Since the price feature was empty, I need to consider if this is actually a valid item node or if there might be another way to find the price. Let me check if this node has any brand connections or other relationships that might help identify the actual product.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 6: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The node has a brand connection to brand_0. Let me check the brand name to better understand what product this might be. Then I can check if there are other items from the same brand that might have proper pricing information, or perhaps this item has other relationships that could help.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[brand_0, name]
Observation 7: The name feature of brand_0 are: Reason Magazine. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: Now I understand this is an item from "Reason Magazine" brand. However, the title appears to be corrupted HTML code and the price feature was empty. Let me check if this item has other relationships like also_viewed_items or also_bought_items that might help identify similar products with proper pricing information. Alternatively, I should check if there are other items from the same brand that might have complete information.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 8: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I have a list of also_viewed_item neighbors for this problematic node. Since the original item has an incomplete title and missing price, I should check one of these related items to see if they have proper pricing information. However, I need to be careful - the question specifically asks for the price of the item with the HTML fragment in its title. Let me first check if any of these related items might actually be the same product with proper information, or if I should look for other approaches.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00005N7R5, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B00005N7R5 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I see that another node (B00005N7R5) also has the exact same HTML fragment as its title feature. This suggests there might be multiple items with this corrupted HTML title. Let me check the price feature of this second node to see if it has pricing information.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00005N7R5, price]
Observation 10: The price feature of B00005N7R5 are: . 
Thought 11: Thought 11: Both nodes I've checked so far have the same corrupted HTML title and empty price features. This suggests there might be a systematic issue with these items. Let me check a few more of the also_viewed_item neighbors to see if any of them have proper titles and pricing information that might help identify what this product actually is.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 11: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 12: Thought 12: The node B000UHI2LW might not exist or I might have made an error. Let me try checking the title feature of another also_viewed_item neighbor to see if I can find items with proper titles that might help identify what this product is.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B002PXW18E, title]
Observation 12: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm encountering issues with the also_viewed_item neighbors - they might not exist or I might be using the wrong feature name. Let me try a different approach. Since the original item node has a brand connection to "Reason Magazine", let me check what other items are associated with this brand to see if I can find similar products with proper pricing information.
Action 13: Action 13: NeighbourCheck[brand_0, item]
Observation 13: The item neighbors of brand_0 are: ['B00005N7NQ']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I see that brand_0 ("Reason Magazine") only has one item neighbor, which is the original problematic node B00005N7NQ. This suggests this might be the only item from this brand in the graph. Since both items I checked with the HTML fragment title have empty price features, and the brand only has this one item, I need to conclude that the price information for this specific item is not available in the graph. The question asks for the price of the item with the HTML fragment title, but the price feature appears to be missing for this item.
Action 14: Thought 15: Based on my investigation, the item with the title containing "<span class=\"a-size-medium a-color-secondary\"" has an empty price feature in the graph. Both nodes I checked (B00005N7NQ and B00005N7R5) that match this title pattern have no price information. Since the brand "Reason Magazine" only has one associated item (B00005N7NQ) and I cannot find pricing information through related items, I must conclude that the price is not available in the graph database.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Action 15: Finish[Price information not available]
Action 15: Based on my investigation of the graph, the item with the title containing "<span class=\"a-size-medium a-color-secondary\"" has an empty price feature. Both nodes matching this title pattern (B00005N7NQ and B00005N7R5) have no price information available in their features. The brand "Reason Magazine" associated with this item also has no other items in the graph that could provide alternative pricing information.
