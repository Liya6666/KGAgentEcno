Question: Given this request: mares prestige octopus, what is the supplementary item?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Given this request: mares prestige octopus, what is the supplementary item? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for a "supplementary item" related to "mares prestige octopus". I need to understand what "supplementary item" means in this context. Looking at the available relationships, it might refer to items that are bought together, also bought, or viewed together. I should first find the node for "mares prestige octopus".
Action 1: RetrieveNode[mares prestige octopus]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_128.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The retrieved node is a brand node (brand_128), not an item node. The question asks for a "supplementary item", which suggests we need to find items related to this brand. Since it's a brand node, I should first find its item neighbors to identify the main product(s) under this brand.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_128, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_128 are: ['B000066HV8']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: Now I have the item node ID B000066HV8 for the "mares prestige octopus" product. The question asks for a "supplementary item", which likely refers to items that are commonly bought together, also bought, or viewed together with this main item. I should check the relationships like bought_together_item, also_bought_item, or also_viewed_item to find supplementary items.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B000066HV8, bought_together_item]
Observation 3: The bought_together_item neighbors of B000066HV8 are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The bought_together_item relationship returned an empty list. I should try other relationship types that might indicate supplementary items, such as also_bought_item or also_viewed_item.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B000066HV8, also_bought_item]
Observation 4: The also_bought_item neighbors of B000066HV8 are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: Both bought_together_item and also_bought_item relationships returned empty lists. I should try the also_viewed_item relationship, as supplementary items might be those that customers viewed together with the main product.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B000066HV8, also_viewed_item]
Observation 5: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B000066HV8 are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: All the common relationship types for supplementary items (bought_together, also_bought, also_viewed) returned empty lists. I should check if there are any other relationships available. Looking back at the graph definition, there's also "buy_after_viewing_item" which might be relevant. Let me try that relationship.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B000066HV8, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 6: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B000066HV8 are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: All relationship checks for supplementary items have returned empty lists. I should verify that I have the correct item node by checking its features to ensure "B000066HV8" is indeed the "mares prestige octopus" product. Then I might need to reconsider what "supplementary item" means in this context - perhaps it refers to the brand itself or there might be a different interpretation.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B000066HV8, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B000066HV8 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The title feature seems to be returning HTML code rather than a readable product title. This suggests there might be an issue with the node or I need to check other features. Let me try retrieving the description or category to confirm this is indeed the "mares prestige octopus" product.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B000066HV8, description]
Observation 8: The description feature of B000066HV8 are: ['Equine magazine devoted to all aspects of the Arabian breed including care, health, breeding, horsemanship, showmanship and the Arabian horse industry in general.']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The description mentions "Equine magazine" and "Arabian breed" which doesn't seem related to "mares prestige octopus" (which sounds like scuba diving equipment). This suggests I may have the wrong node. Let me try retrieving the node again with a different approach or check if "mares prestige octopus" might be a brand name that needs to be handled differently.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[mares prestige octopus item]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_644.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I retrieved a different brand node (brand_644) this time. Let me check its item neighbors to find the actual product.
Action 10: Action 10: NeighbourCheck[brand_644, item]
Observation 10: The item neighbors of brand_644 are: ['B0006SJ21Y']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: Now I have a new item node ID B0006SJ21Y. I should check its features to confirm it's the correct "mares prestige octopus" product before looking for supplementary items.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B0006SJ21Y, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B0006SJ21Y are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The title feature is again returning HTML code rather than a readable title. Let me check the description feature to confirm this is the correct product.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B0006SJ21Y, description]
Observation 12: The description feature of B0006SJ21Y are: ['If Margaret Mead met James Herriot...and they created a magazine, they would call it Wild Fibers! Welcome to the only magazine that has been most often called, "The National Geographic of the Fiber World." An extraordinary blend of photography, culture, environment and FIBER! Wild Fibers Magazine...']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The description mentions "Wild Fibers Magazine" which doesn't seem related to "mares prestige octopus" (scuba diving equipment). It appears I'm still not finding the correct product. Let me try a different approach - perhaps "mares prestige octopus" is actually an item title rather than a brand name. Let me search for it as an item directly.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[mares prestige octopus item title]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_794.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently retrieving brand nodes instead of item nodes when searching for "mares prestige octopus". This suggests that "mares prestige octopus" might be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me try a different search approach - perhaps I should search for items that might contain these keywords in their title or description.
Action 14: Thought 14: Since direct retrieval of "mares prestige octopus" keeps returning brand nodes, I should try to find item nodes that might be related to this phrase. Perhaps I need to search for items with "mares" or "octopus" in their titles. Let me try retrieving an item node with a more specific query.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I need to reconsider my approach. Since "mares prestige octopus" consistently returns brand nodes, it's likely a brand name. The question asks for a "supplementary item" related to this brand. Perhaps I should look at the brand's item neighbors and then check if any of those items have relationships with other items that could be considered supplementary. Let me first get all items under the brand "mares prestige octopus" and then examine their relationships.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[mares]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_128.
Correct answer: Mares PC Interface for Dive Link 2
