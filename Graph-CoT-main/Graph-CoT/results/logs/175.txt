Question: What is the precise item that corresponds to this query: wanderers chuck wendig?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the precise item that corresponds to this query: wanderers chuck wendig? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the precise item that corresponds to the query "wanderers chuck wendig". I need to find an item node related to this query. Since the query contains what appears to be a book title and author, I should search for an item node with a title containing these keywords.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[wanderers chuck wendig]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_888.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The retrieval returned a brand node (brand_888) instead of an item node. This suggests that "wanderers chuck wendig" might be associated with a brand name. However, the question specifically asks for an "item". I should check the features of this brand node to understand what it represents, and then find the items linked to this brand.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_888, name]
Observation 2: The name feature of brand_888 are: Sporting Classics. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The brand name "Sporting Classics" doesn't match the query "wanderers chuck wendig". This suggests that the initial retrieval might not have found the correct node. I should try a different approach. Since "Wanderers" is likely a book title by Chuck Wendig, I should search for item nodes with "Wanderers" in the title or description.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Wanderers]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_888.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval for "Wanderers" is still returning brand_888, which seems incorrect. I need to refine my search strategy. Perhaps I should search for the full title or try different keyword combinations. Let me try searching for "Wanderers Chuck Wendig" as a more specific phrase.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode["Wanderers Chuck Wendig"]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_888.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The RetrieveNode function seems to be consistently returning brand_888 regardless of the query variation, which suggests there might be an issue with the keyword matching or the graph's indexing. Since the question asks for a precise item corresponding to "wanderers chuck wendig", I should try a different approach. Perhaps I need to search for item nodes that have these keywords in their title or description features. However, the available functions don't directly support searching by feature content. I should check if there are any item nodes linked to brand_888, as they might include the relevant item.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[brand_888, item]
Observation 5: The item neighbors of brand_888 are: ['B00F8P2VSQ']. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: Now I have found an item node (B00F8P2VSQ) linked to brand_888. I should check the features of this item node to see if it matches the query "wanderers chuck wendig". I'll examine its title and description to verify if this is the correct item.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00F8P2VSQ, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00F8P2VSQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The title feature appears to be incomplete or malformed HTML. This might be a data issue. I should check the description feature to get more information about this item, as it might contain the relevant details about "Wanderers" by Chuck Wendig.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00F8P2VSQ, description]
Observation 7: The description feature of B00F8P2VSQ are: ['Edited for the affluent sportsman and written by nationally acclaimed writers who focus on the best equipment and the choicest hunting and fishing destinations around the world.']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The description of item B00F8P2VSQ is about sports equipment and hunting/fishing destinations, which doesn't match "Wanderers" by Chuck Wendig (which is a science fiction novel). This suggests that brand_888 and its associated item are not related to the query. I need to try a different approach. Perhaps I should search for the author's name "Chuck Wendig" or try "Wanderers" with different variations. Let me try searching for "Chuck Wendig" as a keyword.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Chuck Wendig]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00DQ1DUGG.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The retrieval for "Chuck Wendig" returned an item node (B00DQ1DUGG) instead of a brand node. This is promising. I should check the features of this item node to see if it matches "Wanderers" by Chuck Wendig.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00DQ1DUGG, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B00DQ1DUGG are: TV Guide Comic Con Special Edition &quot;Chuck&quot; cast on cover July, 2011. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The title of item B00DQ1DUGG is about a TV Guide Comic Con Special Edition featuring the "Chuck" cast, which is unrelated to Chuck Wendig the author. This appears to be a different "Chuck". I need to refine my search further. Let me try searching for "Wanderers" as a standalone term, or perhaps "Wanderers novel" to be more specific.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Wanderers novel]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_425.
Thought 11: Thought 11: The retrieval for "Wanderers novel" returned a brand node (brand_425). I should check the name of this brand and then find its associated items to see if any match the query.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[brand_425, name]
Observation 11: The name feature of brand_425 are: Literary Review. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The brand name "Literary Review" doesn't directly match "Wanderers" or "Chuck Wendig". I should check the items associated with this brand to see if any might be the novel "Wanderers" by Chuck Wendig.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[brand_425, item]
Observation 12: The item neighbors of brand_425 are: ['B000071GPQ']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I have found an item node (B000071GPQ) linked to brand_425. I should check the features of this item node to see if it matches "Wanderers" by Chuck Wendig.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B000071GPQ, title]
Observation 13: The title feature of B000071GPQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The title feature appears to be incomplete HTML again. I should check the description feature to get more information about this item.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B000071GPQ, description]
Observation 14: The description feature of B000071GPQ are: ['<I>Literary Review</I> was founded in Edinburgh in 1979 by Dr. Anne Smith, head of the English Department at Edinburgh University. She created a lively, intelligent literary magazine for people who love reading, but hate academic and intellectual jargon. Issues include reviews of new books in history, biography, politics, travel, and fiction, and a monthly poetry competition.']. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The description of item B000071GPQ is about the "Literary Review" magazine, not the novel "Wanderers" by Chuck Wendig. This is clearly not the correct item. I need to reconsider my approach. Since direct keyword searches haven't been successful, perhaps I should try searching for the author's full name or the book title in a different format. Let me try searching for "Chuck Wendig Wanderers" as a more specific query.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode["Chuck Wendig Wanderers"]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_888.
Correct answer: Wanderers: A Novel
