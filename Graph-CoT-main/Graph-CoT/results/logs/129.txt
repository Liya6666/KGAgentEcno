Question: Can you tell me the average cost of the items frequently bought with Introduction to Manufacturing Processes?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you tell me the average cost of the items frequently bought with Introduction to Manufacturing Processes? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the average cost of items frequently bought with "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes". First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Introduction to Manufacturing Processes]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_463.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned a brand node (brand_463) instead of an item node. This suggests that "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes" might be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me check what items belong to this brand first.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_463, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_463 are: ['B00007AY02']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: Now I have an item node ID (B00007AY02) that belongs to the brand "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes". The question is asking about items frequently bought with this item, which likely refers to the "also_bought_item" relationships. I need to find the also_bought_item neighbors of this item.
Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00007AY02, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00007AY02 are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: It seems that the item B00007AY02 has no also_bought_item neighbors. This might be because the item doesn't have any recorded "also bought" relationships, or perhaps I need to check other relationship types like "bought_together_item". Let me try checking the bought_together_item neighbors.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B00007AY02, bought_together_item]
Observation 4: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00007AY02 are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: Since both "also_bought_item" and "bought_together_item" returned empty lists for item B00007AY02, I should verify if this is indeed the correct item node. Let me check the features of this item to confirm it matches "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes".
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00007AY02, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00007AY02 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The title feature returned HTML code instead of a proper title, which suggests there might be an issue with the data or the node. Let me try to retrieve the node for "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes" again, but this time I should be more specific or try different variations.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Introduction to Manufacturing Processes book]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_251.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes". Let me try a different approach and search for items that might have this in their title or description. I should look for item nodes that contain relevant keywords.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Manufacturing Processes]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_361.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I keep getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes" or variations. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable by its title, or the title might be stored differently. Let me try to find the item by checking the brand nodes first. Since "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes" appears to be a brand name, let me check what items are associated with brand_463 (from Observation 1) and brand_251 (from Observation 6), and then verify their titles.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[brand_463, name]
Observation 8: The name feature of brand_463 are: Levelprint Ltd. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The brand name for brand_463 is "Levelprint Ltd", not "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes". This means my initial retrieval was incorrect. Let me try a different approach to find the correct item node for "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes". I should search for items with "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes" in their title feature.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Introduction to Manufacturing Processes item]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_361.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes", which suggests this might not be an item title but rather a brand name or the system is having trouble finding the exact match. Let me try a different strategy - I'll search for items that might be related to manufacturing processes and then check their titles to find the correct one.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Manufacturing Processes book]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_251.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes", which suggests this might be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me try a different approach - I'll search for items with "manufacturing" in their title to find relevant items, then check if any match "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes".
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[manufacturing]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_764.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes" or variations. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable by its title, or the title might be stored differently. Let me try a different approach - I'll search for items that might be related to manufacturing processes and then check their features to find the correct one. Since I need to find items frequently bought with this item, I should first identify the correct item node.
Action 12: Thought 12: Since direct retrieval attempts are consistently returning brand nodes, I need to try a different strategy. Let me search for items that might contain "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes" in their title by using a more specific query or by checking the features of items from manufacturing-related brands.
Observation 12: 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm having difficulty retrieving the correct item node for "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes" through direct keyword searches. Let me try a different approach. Since this appears to be a book title, I should search for items in the book category that might contain this title. Let me try to retrieve nodes with a more specific query that includes both the title and category information.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Introduction to Manufacturing Processes book item]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_812.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes", which suggests that either:
Action 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes", which suggests that either this is not an item title in the graph, or the retrieval function is not working as expected for this specific query. Let me try a different approach - I'll search for items that might be related to manufacturing and then manually check their titles to find the correct one.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: Since direct retrieval attempts are consistently returning brand nodes, I need to try a different approach. Let me search for items that might contain "Introduction to Manufacturing Processes" in their title by checking the features of items from manufacturing-related brands. I'll start by getting a list of all item nodes and then check their titles to find the correct one. However, this might be inefficient. Let me try to search for items with "manufacturing" in their title first.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[manufacturing item]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_740.
Correct answer: 45.0
