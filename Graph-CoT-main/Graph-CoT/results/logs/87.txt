Question: Search for other items under the same brand and category as Etude House Fresh Cherry Tint No. 2 Cherry pink.
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Search for other items under the same brand and category as Etude House Fresh Cherry Tint No. 2 Cherry pink. Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for other items under the same brand and category as "Etude House Fresh Cherry Tint No. 2 Cherry pink". First, I need to find the node for this item to get its brand and category.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Etude House Fresh Cherry Tint No. 2 Cherry pink]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_172.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I need to correct my approach. The observation returned a brand node ID, but I was looking for an item node. Let me try retrieving the item with a more precise query.
Action 2: Thought 2: The previous retrieval returned a brand node, which is incorrect. I should try to retrieve the item node with a more specific query, perhaps including the full title or a part of it that is unique. Let me try again with the exact item name.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to retrieve the item node correctly. Let me try using the exact item title as given in the question.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Etude House Fresh Cherry Tint No. 2 Cherry pink]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_172.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval is still returning a brand node instead of the item node. This suggests that the item name might not be indexed directly, or there might be a mismatch. Let me try to retrieve the item by searching for a keyword from its title, such as "Cherry Tint", to find the correct item node.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Cherry Tint]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006K98C.
Thought 5: Thought 5: Good, now I have an item node ID (B00006K98C) that might be the correct one. I should verify if this is indeed the "Etude House Fresh Cherry Tint No. 2 Cherry pink" item by checking its title feature.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00006K98C, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00006K98C are: Cmyk Magazine. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieved node B00006K98C has title "Cmyk Magazine", which doesn't match the item I'm looking for. I need to try a different keyword to find the correct "Etude House Fresh Cherry Tint No. 2 Cherry pink" item. Let me try using "Etude House" as the keyword.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Etude House]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_90.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieval for "Etude House" returned a brand node (brand_90), not the specific item. I need to find the exact item node. Let me try a more specific query with the full product name or try to find items related to the brand first and then narrow down.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Fresh Cherry Tint]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_720.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of the specific item. This suggests that the item name might not be directly retrievable with the given keywords. Let me try a different approach. Since the question mentions "Etude House" as part of the product name, I should first find the brand node for Etude House and then look at its items to find the specific product.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Etude House Fresh Cherry Tint]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_407.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand nodes over item nodes when the query contains brand names. Let me try a different approach: I'll first find the brand node for Etude House, then get all its items, and from those items, find the one with the specific title "Fresh Cherry Tint No. 2 Cherry pink".
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Etude House]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_90.
Thought 10: Thought 10: Now that I have the brand node for Etude House (brand_90), I can get all its items to find the specific product. I need to list all items under this brand and then find the one matching "Fresh Cherry Tint No. 2 Cherry pink".
Action 10: Action 10: NeighbourCheck[brand_90, item]
Observation 10: The item neighbors of brand_90 are: ['B00005R8BL', 'B015HSVUH6']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: I have two item nodes for the Etude House brand: B00005R8BL and B015HSVUH6. I need to check their titles to find which one is "Etude House Fresh Cherry Tint No. 2 Cherry pink".
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00005R8BL, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B00005R8BL are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The title feature for node B00005R8BL appears to be incomplete or malformed. Let me check the title of the other item node to find the correct product.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B015HSVUH6, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B015HSVUH6 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 13: Thought 13: Both item nodes under the Etude House brand have malformed title features. This suggests there might be an issue with the data. However, I need to proceed with the original question. Since I can't identify the exact item, I should try to find its category and brand to answer the question about other items under the same brand and category. Let me check the category of one of these items to proceed.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00005R8BL, category]
Observation 13: The category feature of B00005R8BL are: []. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The category feature for node B00005R8BL is empty. Let me check the category of the other item node to see if it has a category defined.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B015HSVUH6, category]
Observation 14: The category feature of B015HSVUH6 are: []. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: Both items under the Etude House brand have empty categories, which is problematic for answering the question. However, I need to find the specific item mentioned in the question. Let me try a different approach: perhaps the item is not directly under the Etude House brand, or there might be another brand node. Let me try to retrieve the item using a more specific keyword combination.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Cherry pink]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_172.
