Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item Pastry Women's Sugar Rush Vulcanized Sneaker?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item Pastry Women's Sugar Rush Vulcanized Sneaker? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with the item "Pastry Women's Sugar Rush Vulcanized Sneaker". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Pastry Women's Sugar Rush Vulcanized Sneaker]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_245.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned "brand_245" as the ID, but the question is asking about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the item node again with the exact title.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Pastry Women's Sugar Rush Vulcanized Sneaker]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_245.
Thought 3: Thought 3: It seems the retrieval is consistently returning a brand node instead of an item node. This might indicate that the item title is actually associated with a brand in the graph, or there could be a mismatch. Let me try to retrieve the node with a slightly different approach. Perhaps I should look for nodes that have this phrase in their title feature.
Action 3: Thought 3: Since direct retrieval by title isn't working, I should try to find the item node by searching for nodes with this title as a feature. I'll need to use a different approach, perhaps by finding brand nodes first and then their items.
Observation 3: 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Since direct retrieval by the full title isn't working, I should try to find the item node by first identifying the brand. The title mentions "Pastry" which might be the brand name. Let me retrieve the brand node for "Pastry".
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Pastry]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7QH.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval for "Pastry" returned a node ID "B00005N7QH", but this doesn't look like a brand node ID (which typically start with "brand_"). This might be an item node. Let me check the features of this node to confirm what type it is and what its title is.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00005N7QH, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00005N7QH are: Gourmet (1-year). 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The node B00005N7QH has a title "Gourmet (1-year)" which doesn't match the item we're looking for. This suggests that retrieving by "Pastry" alone isn't working. Let me try to retrieve the brand node for "Pastry" more specifically, as "Pastry" is likely the brand name in the item title.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Pastry brand]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_245.
Thought 7: Thought 7: Now I have the brand node ID "brand_245" for Pastry. Since the question is about an item, I need to find the specific item node with the title "Pastry Women's Sugar Rush Vulcanized Sneaker". I should look at the items linked to this brand to find the correct one.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[brand_245, item]
Observation 7: The item neighbors of brand_245 are: ['B00006KMW1', 'B00006KMVV', 'B00007AZEO', 'B00007KY38']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I have the item nodes linked to the Pastry brand. Now I need to find which one has the title "Pastry Women's Sugar Rush Vulcanized Sneaker". I'll check the title feature of each item node to identify the correct one.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00006KMW1, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B00006KMW1 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than the actual title. This suggests there might be an issue with how the features are stored. Let me try checking the title feature for another item node from the brand to see if I can get a proper title.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00006KMVV, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B00006KMVV are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: It seems that the title features for these item nodes are returning HTML code instead of readable titles. This might be a data issue. Let me try to check the category or description features to see if I can identify the correct item. Alternatively, I can try to retrieve the node using a different keyword from the title.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Sugar Rush Vulcanized Sneaker]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_799.
Thought 11: Thought 11: The retrieval for "Sugar Rush Vulcanized Sneaker" returned another brand node (brand_799), which isn't helpful. Since the direct approach isn't working, I need to find the item node by its also_viewed_item relationships. The question is about co-viewed items, so I should first find the also_viewed_item neighbors of the target item. But I still need to identify the correct item node. Let me try to retrieve the node using a more specific part of the title.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Pastry Women's Sugar Rush]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7XT.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I retrieved a node with ID B00005N7XT using "Pastry Women's Sugar Rush". Let me check its title feature to confirm if this is the correct item node.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00005N7XT, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B00005N7XT are: Diabetic Cooking. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The title "Diabetic Cooking" doesn't match the item we're looking for. This is not the correct item. I need to try a different approach. Since the question is about co-viewed items, perhaps I can find items that have "Sugar Rush" or "Vulcanized Sneaker" in their title by checking features of all item nodes, but that might be inefficient. Let me try to retrieve the node with the exact title again, but perhaps the system has a specific way of handling titles with special characters or spaces.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode["Pastry Women's Sugar Rush Vulcanized Sneaker"]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_911.
Thought 14: Thought 14: The retrieval keeps returning brand nodes instead of the item node. This suggests that the item title might not be directly retrievable, or there's an issue with how the title is stored. Since the question is about co-viewed items, I should focus on finding items that share also_viewed_item neighbors. But first, I need to identify the correct item node. Let me try to find the item by checking the also_viewed_item relationships of items from the Pastry brand. I'll start by getting the also_viewed_item neighbors for one of the Pastry brand items and see if any have a title that matches or is similar.
Action 14: Action 14: NeighbourCheck[B00006KMW1, also_viewed_item]
Observation 14: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00006KMW1 are: []. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The also_viewed_item neighbors for B00006KMW1 are empty, which is unusual. Let me try another item from the Pastry brand to see if any have also_viewed_item neighbors.
Action 15: Action 15: NeighbourCheck[B00006KMVV, also_viewed_item]
Observation 15: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00006KMVV are: [].
