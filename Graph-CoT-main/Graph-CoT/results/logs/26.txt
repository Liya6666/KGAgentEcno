Question: Could you tell me the price of Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Could you tell me the price of Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item called "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing". First, I need to find the item node in the graph using its title.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_567.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned a node ID "brand_567", which appears to be a brand node rather than an item node. This suggests that the retrieval might have matched a brand name instead of the item title. I should try to retrieve the item node more specifically, perhaps by including more context from the title or using a different approach.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_567.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is still returning a brand node instead of an item node. This suggests that the graph might have a brand with a similar name, or the item title might be stored differently. I should try to retrieve the node using a partial match or consider that the item might be listed under a slightly different title. Alternatively, I could look for items related to "Big Nate" and then narrow it down.
Action 3: RetrieveNode[Big Nate Here Goes Nothing]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_567.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node (brand_567) instead of an item node. This suggests that "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing" might be a brand name rather than an item title in this graph. Since the question is asking for the price of an item, I should consider that there might be an item associated with this brand. I should check what items are linked to this brand node.
Action 4: NeighbourCheck[brand_567, item]
Observation 4: The item neighbors of brand_567 are: ['B00009R5PH']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: Now I have found an item node ID ('B00009R5PH') associated with the brand_567. Since the question is asking for the price of an item related to "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing", this is likely the correct item. I should check the price feature of this item node.
Action 5: NodeFeature[B00009R5PH, price]
Observation 5: The price feature of B00009R5PH are: . 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The observation returned an empty price feature for the item node. This might indicate that the price information is missing or that this isn't the correct item. I should verify if this is indeed the item titled "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing" by checking its title feature.
Action 6: NodeFeature[B00009R5PH, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00009R5PH are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The title feature appears to be incomplete or malformed HTML. This suggests that the item node might not be properly formatted or that there's an issue with the data. I should try to find other items associated with the brand "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing" or try a different approach to locate the correct item node. Since the brand node was consistently retrieved, perhaps there are multiple items associated with this brand.
Action 7: NodeDegree[brand_567, item]
Observation 7: The item neighbor node degree of brand_567 are: 1. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The brand node has only one item neighbor (degree 1), which is the node B00009R5PH we already checked. Since the title feature was incomplete and price was empty, I should try to retrieve the item node using a different approach. Perhaps the item title is stored differently in the graph. I should try to search for items with "Big Nate" in their title.
Action 8: RetrieveNode[Big Nate item]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000YZB2HG.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I retrieved a new item node (B000YZB2HG) using "Big Nate item". I should check if this is the correct item by examining its title feature to see if it matches "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing".
Action 9: NodeFeature[B000YZB2HG, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B000YZB2HG are: Nick Jr. Magazine. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The title "Nick Jr. Magazine" doesn't match "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing". This suggests that the retrieval using "Big Nate item" didn't find the correct item. I should try a more specific search or consider that the item might be listed under a different title. Since the brand node brand_567 was consistently retrieved for "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing", and it has only one item neighbor (B00009R5PH), but that item has incomplete data, I should check if there are other brand nodes related to "Big Nate" that might have the correct item.
Action 10: RetrieveNode[Big Nate brand]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_728.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I found another brand node (brand_728) for "Big Nate". I should check what items are associated with this brand to see if any match "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing".
Action 11: NeighbourCheck[brand_728, item]
Observation 11: The item neighbors of brand_728 are: ['B000INCK4I', 'B005DNAMPM', 'B005DNA3LU', 'B005DNCFP2', 'B005DNCU20', 'B005DNB4SG']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I have multiple item nodes associated with brand_728. I need to check the title features of these items to find which one matches "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing". I'll start by checking the first item node.
Action 12: NodeFeature[B000INCK4I, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B000INCK4I are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The title feature for B000INCK4I is also incomplete HTML, similar to the previous item node. This suggests there might be a data formatting issue in the graph. I should continue checking the other item nodes associated with brand_728 to find one with a proper title that matches "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing". I'll check the next item node.
Action 13: NodeFeature[B005DNAMPM, title]
Observation 13: The title feature of B005DNAMPM are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 14: Thought 14: All the item nodes I've checked so far have incomplete title features with HTML tags. This suggests there might be a systematic issue with how title data is stored in this graph. Since the question specifically asks for the price of "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing", and I've found brand nodes related to Big Nate, I should try a different approach. Perhaps I can search for items with "Here Goes Nothing" in the title or try to find the correct item through its category or description features.
Action 14: RetrieveNode[Here Goes Nothing item]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_554.
Thought 15: Thought 15: The retrieval for "Here Goes Nothing item" returned another brand node (brand_554) instead of an item node. This suggests that "Here Goes Nothing" might also be a brand name in this graph. Given the difficulties in finding the correct item node with complete data, I should try to directly search for the price by considering that "Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing" might be the brand name, and check if any of its items have a price. Since brand_567 had one item (B00009R5PH) but with empty price, I should check if there are other items associated with it or if I missed something. Alternatively, I can try to search for the item using its category or description, but that might be too broad. Let me try to retrieve the node with the exact title including the colon and spaces properly.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode["Big Nate: Here Goes Nothing" exact title]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7RV.
Correct answer: 8.54
