Question: How many co-viewed items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many co-viewed items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of co-viewed items for a specific item. The item's title appears to be incomplete or possibly corrupted - "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" looks like HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the node using this string as it appears in the question.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00005N7NQ), I need to find out how many co-viewed items this item has. The question mentions "co-viewed items" which likely corresponds to the "also_viewed_item" relationship in the graph definition. I should check the node degree for this relationship type.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 24. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The question asks for the number of co-viewed items, and I've found that there are 24 also_viewed_item neighbors. However, the question specifically requests that I provide the answer using "node main feature (e.g., names)" rather than just the count. This suggests I need to list the actual titles of these co-viewed items, not just the count.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I now have the list of 24 also_viewed_item node IDs. To answer the question properly, I need to retrieve the main feature (title) for each of these item nodes, as requested. I should get the title feature for each neighbor node.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 4: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I encountered an error when trying to get the title feature for node B000UHI2LW. This suggests that either the node ID is incorrect or I need to use a different approach. Let me try retrieving the node using its ID first to verify it exists, then try to get its title feature.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I see the issue now. When I retrieved node B000UHI2LW, it returned a brand node (brand_756) rather than an item node. This suggests that some of the neighbors might be brand nodes rather than item nodes. However, the question specifically asks about "co-viewed items," so I should focus only on item nodes. Let me check what type of node B00005N7NQ is first, and then reconsider my approach.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I see that B00005N7NQ is indeed an item node with the title matching what was given in the question. However, when I tried to get the title of one of its also_viewed_item neighbors (B000UHI2LW), it turned out to be a brand node. This suggests that the also_viewed_item relationship might include both item and brand nodes, or there might be an issue with the neighbor list. Let me check the node type of B000UHI2LW more explicitly by trying to get a brand feature.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, name]
Observation 7: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm encountering issues with the neighbor nodes. Let me try a different approach. Since B000UHI2LW was identified as a brand node when I retrieved it, but the question specifically asks for "co-viewed items," I should verify the node types of all the neighbors. Let me check if B000UHI2LW has item features by trying to get its category (an item feature).
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, category]
Observation 8: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm having difficulty accessing features of the neighbor nodes. Since B000UHI2LW was identified as a brand node when retrieved, but the question specifically asks for "co-viewed items," I should focus on getting the titles of the also_viewed_item neighbors that are actually item nodes. Let me try retrieving one of the other neighbor IDs to see if it's an item node.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[B002PXW18E]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm noticing a pattern here - when I retrieve the also_viewed_item neighbors by their IDs, they're being identified as brand nodes rather than item nodes. This suggests that the neighbor list might be showing brand IDs instead of item IDs, or there's an issue with how the relationships are structured. Let me try a different approach - I should check what type of neighbors the also_viewed_item relationship actually connects to by examining the graph definition more carefully.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, category]
Observation 10: The category feature of B00005N7NQ are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: I see that B00005N7NQ is indeed an item node with a valid category. The issue seems to be that the also_viewed_item neighbors are being returned as brand nodes rather than item nodes. According to the graph definition, item nodes should be linked to "also_viewed_item nodes" which should be other item nodes. There might be an inconsistency in how the neighbors are being returned. Let me try to get the actual item titles by checking if these neighbor IDs might be brand nodes that are connected to the actual also_viewed items. Perhaps I need to follow the brand connections to get to the actual items.
Action 11: Thought 11: I'm realizing there might be a misunderstanding in how the graph relationships work. According to the graph definition, item nodes should be linked to "also_viewed_item nodes" which should be other item nodes. However, when I retrieve the neighbor IDs from the also_viewed_item relationship, they're returning as brand nodes. This suggests that either the neighbor IDs are actually brand IDs, or there's a different relationship I should be using. Let me check if there's a "co-viewed" relationship specifically, or if "also_viewed_item" is indeed the correct relationship for "co-viewed items."
Observation 11: 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I need to reconsider the problem. The question asks for "co-viewed items" and specifically requests that I provide the answer using node main features (names/titles) rather than just a count. However, when I retrieved the also_viewed_item neighbors, they appear to be brand nodes rather than item nodes. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I should check if there's a different relationship type that connects to actual item nodes, or if I need to follow the brand connections to get to the items.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, brand]
Observation 12: The brand neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['brand_0']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I see that B00005N7NQ has a brand neighbor 'brand_0'. However, this doesn't directly help with finding the co-viewed items. Let me try checking if the also_viewed_item relationship might be returning brand nodes that are connected to the actual co-viewed items. Perhaps I need to get the items associated with these brand nodes to find the actual co-viewed items.
Action 13: Action 13: NeighbourCheck[brand_0, item]
Observation 13: The item neighbors of brand_0 are: ['B00005N7NQ']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I see that brand_0 only has B00005N7NQ as its item neighbor, which doesn't help with finding co-viewed items. I'm still struggling with the fact that the also_viewed_item neighbors are returning as brand nodes. Let me try a different approach - perhaps the issue is that the neighbor IDs returned by NeighbourCheck are actually item IDs, but when I use RetrieveNode with these IDs, it's interpreting them incorrectly. Let me try to directly get the title feature of one of the neighbor IDs without retrieving the node first.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 14: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm encountering persistent issues with accessing the also_viewed_item neighbors. Let me reconsider the problem from the beginning. The question asks for "co-viewed items" and specifically requests that I provide the answer using node main features (titles). Since the also_viewed_item relationship appears to be returning brand nodes rather than item nodes, perhaps I should interpret "co-viewed items" differently. Maybe "co-viewed" refers to items that share the same brand or have some other relationship. Let me check if there are other relationship types that might connect to actual item nodes.
Action 15: Thought 15: I'm still struggling with the fact that the also_viewed_item neighbors are returning as brand nodes. Let me try checking other relationship types that might connect to actual item nodes, such as "also_bought_item" or "bought_together_item", to see if they return item nodes instead of brand nodes.
Observation 15:
Correct answer: 19
