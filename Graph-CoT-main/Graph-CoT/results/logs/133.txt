Question: What is the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with "Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition". First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KY4V.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the items that are often viewed together with this book. According to the graph definition, items are linked to "also_viewed_item" nodes. I should get the list of these items.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00006KY4V, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00006KY4V are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that there are no also_viewed_item neighbors for this node. However, the question mentions "items that are often viewed together", which might correspond to other relationship types. Let me check if there are other similar relationships like "buy_after_viewing_item", "also_bought_item", or "bought_together_item" that might contain relevant items.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00006KY4V, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 3: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00006KY4V are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Since both "also_viewed_item" and "buy_after_viewing_item" returned empty lists, let me check the "also_bought_item" relationship, as items bought together might also be viewed together.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B00006KY4V, also_bought_item]
Observation 4: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00006KY4V are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: All the relationship checks for "also_viewed_item", "buy_after_viewing_item", and "also_bought_item" returned empty lists. Let me check the last possible relationship type: "bought_together_item" to see if there are any items that are typically purchased together with this book.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00006KY4V, bought_together_item]
Observation 5: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00006KY4V are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: It appears that the item "Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition" (node B00006KY4V) has no neighbors in any of the relationship types that would indicate items viewed or bought together. This might be due to the specific graph structure or data availability. However, the question asks for the typical cost of items often viewed together, so I need to find an alternative approach. Since there are no direct neighbors, I should check if there are other items linked to the same brand or category that might be relevant, but the question specifically asks for items viewed together. Given the lack of neighbors, I might need to conclude that there are no such items, or perhaps the item is isolated in the graph. Let me verify if the node exists and has basic features to ensure it's a valid item.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00006KY4V, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00006KY4V are: Star Date : the Astronomy News Report. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: There seems to be a discrepancy. The retrieved node ID B00006KY4V has the title "Star Date : the Astronomy News Report", which doesn't match "Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition". This suggests that the initial retrieval might have been incorrect. I need to retrieve the correct node for "Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition".
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Principles of Solar Engineering Second Edition]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KY4V.
Thought 8: Thought 8: The retrieval still returns the same node ID with a mismatched title. This indicates that the graph might not have an exact match for "Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition". I should try to retrieve with a partial or alternative query to find the correct node.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Solar Engineering]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_512.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The retrieval for "Solar Engineering" returned a brand node (brand_512) instead of an item node. This is not helpful for finding the specific book. I need to try a more precise query for the book title. Let me try retrieving with the full title without punctuation.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Principles of Solar Engineering Second Edition]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00006KY4V.
Thought 10: Thought 10: The retrieval consistently returns node B00006KY4V with the title "Star Date : the Astronomy News Report", which doesn't match the query. This suggests that the graph might not contain the exact item "Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition". However, since the question asks about items viewed together with it, I should check if there are any items with similar titles or in the same category that might be relevant. Alternatively, I can try to find the node by its features if available. Let me check the category or description of node B00006KY4V to see if it's related to solar engineering.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00006KY4V, category]
Observation 10: The category feature of B00006KY4V are: []. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The category is empty for this node. Let me check the description to see if it matches "Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition".
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00006KY4V, description]
Observation 11: The description feature of B00006KY4V are: []. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The node B00006KY4V has empty category and description features, and its title doesn't match the query. This suggests that the graph might not contain the exact item "Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition". Since I cannot find the correct item node, I cannot proceed to find its also_viewed_item neighbors or their prices. I should conclude that the item is not in the graph or the data is unavailable.
Action 12: Based on the graph interactions, the item "Principles of Solar Engineering, Second Edition" could not be accurately identified in the graph. The retrieved node (B00006KY4V) has the title "Star Date : the Astronomy News Report", which does not match the query, and it lacks category and description features that could confirm its identity. Additionally, this node has no neighbors in any relationship types (also_viewed_item, buy_after_viewing_item, also_bought_item, bought_together_item), meaning there are no items linked as "often viewed together" with it. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the typical cost of such items from the graph data.
