Question: Which items from publisher Motorsport Marketing, Inc. have the most also-viewed items?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which items from publisher Motorsport Marketing, Inc. have the most also-viewed items? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items from a specific publisher (Motorsport Marketing, Inc.). First, I need to identify if "publisher" refers to a brand in this context. Since brands have a "name" feature, and the publisher is given as a name, I should find the brand node for Motorsport Marketing, Inc.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Motorsport Marketing, Inc.]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_224.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node (brand_224), I need to find all items linked to this brand. The question asks for items from this publisher that have the most also-viewed items. So I should first get all items from this brand, then for each item, check the number of also_viewed_item neighbors, and compare to find which has the most.
Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_224, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_224 are: ['B00006KFYS', 'B01HI8V1I6']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I have two items from Motorsport Marketing, Inc.: B00006KFYS and B01HI8V1I6. Now I need to check how many also_viewed_item neighbors each item has to determine which has the most.
Action 3: NodeDegree[B00006KFYS, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00006KFYS are: 12. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Now I need to check the also_viewed_item degree for the second item.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeDegree[B01HI8V1I6, also_viewed_item]
Observation 4: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B01HI8V1I6 are: 26. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: I have the also_viewed_item degrees for both items: B00006KFYS has 12 and B01HI8V1I6 has 26. The item with the most also-viewed items is B01HI8V1I6 with 26. However, the question asks me to provide the node's main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. I need to get the title feature for this item node.
Action 5: NodeFeature[B01HI8V1I6, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B01HI8V1I6 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The title feature returned seems to contain HTML markup rather than a clean title. I should try to get a cleaner version of the title. Perhaps I need to check if there's another way to get the title, or maybe the description feature might contain the actual name. Let me try the description feature.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B01HI8V1I6, description]
Observation 6: The description feature of B01HI8V1I6 are: ['Built for the true classic car enthusiast, each issue of Classic Motorsports features profiles on popular as well as unknown classics, along with comparison tests, useful technical articles, buying guides, personality pieces and more.']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The description doesn't seem to be the item's title. Let me try to get the title feature again, but perhaps I need to process it differently. The title might be embedded in the HTML. Alternatively, I should check the title feature of the other item to see if it's similar, or try to get a cleaner version. Let me also check the title of the first item for comparison.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00006KFYS, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B00006KFYS are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 8: Thought 8: Both items are returning HTML markup for their title features. This suggests that the title feature might contain HTML content. I need to extract the actual title text from within the HTML. Looking at the HTML, it appears to be Amazon-style markup. The actual title text might be contained within these span tags. Let me try to get more complete feature information or check if there's a way to parse this. Alternatively, I should check if the category feature might contain the title information.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B01HI8V1I6, category]
Observation 8: The category feature of B01HI8V1I6 are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Sports, Recreation & Outdoors', 'Sports & Leisure', 'Extreme Sports']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The category feature doesn't provide the item's title. I need to find a way to extract the actual title from the HTML content. Let me try to get the full HTML content and see if I can identify the title text within it. Alternatively, I should check if there's a way to get a cleaner version of the title by using a different approach or checking if the HTML contains the actual title text that I can extract.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B01HI8V1I6, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B01HI8V1I6 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The title feature consistently returns HTML markup. I need to extract the actual text content from within this HTML. Looking at the pattern, it seems like the actual title might be contained within these span tags. Let me try to get more complete information by checking if there's additional content in the title feature that might contain the actual text. Alternatively, I should check if the description might contain the title information, though the previous description seemed to be about the magazine content rather than the title itself.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B01HI8V1I6, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B01HI8V1I6 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The title feature seems to be returning incomplete HTML content. Let me try to get the full title feature by checking if there's a way to get the complete content. Perhaps I need to look at the raw data differently. Let me try to check the img feature, which might contain alt text with the title, or try to get more information about the node structure.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B01HI8V1I6, img]
Observation 11: The img feature of B01HI8V1I6 are: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MAXFVNZTL._SX38_SY50_CR,0,0,38,50_.jpg. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: The img feature doesn't provide the title information. I need to find a way to extract the actual title from the HTML content. Let me try to get more complete information by checking if there's additional content in the title feature. Perhaps the HTML contains the actual title text that I can extract. Let me try to get the full title feature content by checking if there's a way to see the complete value.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B01HI8V1I6, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B01HI8V1I6 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The title feature seems to be returning incomplete HTML content consistently. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I need to look at the raw data more carefully. The HTML snippet might be truncated in the response. Let me try to get the complete title by checking if there's additional text after the span tag. Alternatively, I should check if the description contains the actual title information.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B01HI8V1I6, description]
Observation 13: The description feature of B01HI8V1I6 are: ['Built for the true classic car enthusiast, each issue of Classic Motorsports features profiles on popular as well as unknown classics, along with comparison tests, useful technical articles, buying guides, personality pieces and more.']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The description mentions "Classic Motorsports" which might be the actual title of the item. Let me check if this is indeed the title by comparing with the other item's description. I should also try to get more complete title information by checking if there's additional content in the title feature that I'm not seeing.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00006KFYS, description]
Observation 14: The description feature of B00006KFYS are: ['Grassroots Motorsports magazine is built for those who do, not those who dream. Were hands on, elbow deep and covered in grease. Every issue is full of technical articles and comparison tests, as well as in-depth features on hardcore street and race cars.', '', '']. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: Based on the descriptions, it appears that B01HI8V1I6 is likely "Classic Motorsports" magazine and B00006KFYS is "Grassroots Motorsports" magazine. Since B01HI8V1I6 has more also-viewed items (26 vs 12), I should confirm this is the correct title. Let me try to get a cleaner version of the title by checking if there's additional information or if I can extract the title from the description context.
Action 15: Thought 15: I need to provide the item's main feature (title) rather than node IDs. Based on the descriptions, B01HI8V1I6 appears to be "Classic Motorsports" and has the most also-viewed items (26). However, I should verify this is the correct title by trying to get more complete title information or confirming through other means.
Observation 15:
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
