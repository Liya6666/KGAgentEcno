Question: How many also-bought items does item The ABC's of AutoLISP have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many also-bought items does item The ABC's of AutoLISP have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of also_bought_item neighbors for the item "The ABC's of AutoLISP". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[The ABC's of AutoLISP]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_641.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_641" as the node ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should try to retrieve the item node again with a more precise query or consider if there's a mismatch.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[The ABC's of AutoLISP item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_641.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node (brand_641) instead of an item node. This suggests that "The ABC's of AutoLISP" might actually be a brand name rather than an item title. I should check the features of this brand node to confirm its name.
Action 3: NodeFeature[brand_641, name]
Observation 3: The name feature of brand_641 are: Auto &amp; Design Srl. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The observation shows that brand_641 has the name "Auto & Design Srl", which doesn't match "The ABC's of AutoLISP". This indicates that my initial retrieval might have been incorrect. I need to find the actual item node for "The ABC's of AutoLISP". Perhaps I should try a different approach - maybe searching for items that have "The ABC's of AutoLISP" in their title or description.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[The ABC's of AutoLISP item title]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_641.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval is still returning brand_641, which suggests that the keyword-based retrieval might be limited. Since the question specifically asks about an item, I should try to find items that might be related to "The ABC's of AutoLISP" by exploring other nodes. Perhaps I can look for items with similar names or check if there are any items linked to this brand that might be relevant.
Action 5: Thought 5: Since the retrieval is consistently returning brand_641 instead of an item node, I should explore the items associated with this brand to see if any of them might be "The ABC's of AutoLISP". I can check what items are linked to brand_641.
Observation 5: 
Thought 6: Thought 6: Since the retrieval is consistently returning brand_641 instead of an item node, I should explore the items associated with this brand to see if any of them might be "The ABC's of AutoLISP". I can check what items are linked to brand_641.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[brand_641, item]
Observation 6: The item neighbors of brand_641 are: ['B0006A70HA']. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: Now I have an item node ID 'B0006A70HA' that is linked to brand_641. I should check the features of this item node to see if it matches "The ABC's of AutoLISP".
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B0006A70HA, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B0006A70HA are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than a readable title. This suggests there might be an issue with the data. I should try to retrieve the node using a different approach or check other features of this item to identify it.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B0006A70HA, description]
Observation 8: The description feature of B0006A70HA are: ['Auto &amp; Design is focused on automotive and industrial design. It contains articles on cutting-edge ideas and designs, leading manufacturers of a wide variety of cars and other products, technical information, and detailed photo spreads.', '', '']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The description doesn't match "The ABC's of AutoLISP" - it seems to be about automotive design. This suggests that brand_641 and its associated item are not related to the query. I need to try a different approach to find the correct item node. Perhaps I should search for items with "AutoLISP" in their title or description.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[AutoLISP]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_641.
Thought 10: Thought 10: The retrieval is still returning brand_641 when searching for "AutoLISP". This suggests that the keyword-based retrieval might be prioritizing brand nodes over item nodes. Since the question specifically asks about an item called "The ABC's of AutoLISP", I should try to find items that might have this in their title by exploring other nodes or using a different search strategy. Perhaps I can search for "ABC" or try to find items related to programming or AutoCAD, as AutoLISP is a programming language for AutoCAD.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[ABC's of AutoLISP]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_641.
Thought 11: Thought 11: The retrieval is consistently returning brand_641 for various queries related to "AutoLISP" or "ABC's of AutoLISP". This suggests that the keyword-based retrieval might be limited in finding the specific item. Since the question asks about "also-bought items", I should try to find the item node by exploring related items or using a different approach. Perhaps I can search for items with "AutoLISP" in their category or description features, but I need a way to find relevant items first.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[The ABC's of AutoLISP programming]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_641.
Thought 12: Thought 12: The retrieval is consistently returning brand_641 for all queries related to "The ABC's of AutoLISP". This suggests that the keyword-based retrieval function might have limitations in finding specific item nodes. Since the question asks about "also-bought items" of a specific item, I need to find the correct item node first. Let me try a different approach - perhaps searching for items that might be related to programming or AutoCAD, as AutoLISP is a programming language for AutoCAD.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[AutoCAD]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_641.
Thought 13: Thought 13: The retrieval is consistently returning brand_641 for all queries, which suggests the keyword-based retrieval might be limited or there's an issue with the graph indexing. Since I need to find the specific item "The ABC's of AutoLISP", I should try to explore other nodes that might be related. Perhaps I can search for items with "LISP" in their title or try to find programming-related items.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[LISP]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_605.
Thought 14: Thought 14: The retrieval for "LISP" returned a different brand node (brand_605) instead of brand_641. This suggests there might be multiple brands related to these terms. I should check the name of brand_605 to see if it's more relevant to "The ABC's of AutoLISP".
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[brand_605, name]
Observation 14: The name feature of brand_605 are: Dialogue. 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The brand_605 has the name "Dialogue", which doesn't seem related to "The ABC's of AutoLISP". This approach isn't working well. Since the question specifically asks about "The ABC's of AutoLISP" item, I should try to search for items with "ABC" in their title, as this might be more distinctive than "AutoLISP" or "LISP".
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[ABC's of AutoLISP item exact]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_641.
Correct answer: 0
