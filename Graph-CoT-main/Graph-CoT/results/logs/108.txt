Question: What is the item that has over 4 products frequently bought along with Hanes Men's Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the item that has over 4 products frequently bought along with Hanes Men's Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for an item that has over 4 products frequently bought along with Hanes Men's Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband. First, I need to find the node for "Hanes Men's Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband" to get its ID.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Hanes Men's Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_644.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that Observation 1 returned a brand node (brand_644) instead of an item node. This suggests that "Hanes Men's Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband" might be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me check what items are associated with this brand.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_644, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_644 are: ['B0006SJ21Y']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: Now I have an item ID (B0006SJ21Y) associated with the brand. Let me verify if this is indeed the "Hanes Men's Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband" item by checking its title feature.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeFeature[B0006SJ21Y, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B0006SJ21Y are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than a readable title. This suggests there might be an issue with the node. Let me try to retrieve the node again using a different approach. Perhaps the item title is slightly different. Let me search for nodes containing "Hanes" and "Knit Pant" to find the correct item node.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Hanes Knit Pant]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000RFQ1LA.
Thought 5: Thought 5: Now I have a new item ID (B000RFQ1LA) that might be the correct item. Let me check its title feature to confirm if this is "Hanes Men's Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband".
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B000RFQ1LA, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B000RFQ1LA are: Sandra Knitting - English ed.

Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Hanes Men's Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_644.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm getting the same brand node again when searching for the full item title. This suggests that the item might not be indexed under that exact name, or there might be a mismatch. Let me try to find items related to Hanes brand that might be knit pants. First, let me check what items are associated with the Hanes brand (brand_644).
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[brand_644, item]
Observation 7: The item neighbors of brand_644 are: ['B0006SJ21Y']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I only have one item associated with brand_644, but its title didn't match. Let me check if there are other brands with "Hanes" in their name. Perhaps the brand node I found isn't the correct one for this item. Let me search for brands containing "Hanes".
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Hanes]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_575.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I found another brand node (brand_575) when searching for "Hanes". Let me check what items are associated with this brand to see if it contains the knit pants item.
Action 9: Action 9: NeighbourCheck[brand_575, item]
Observation 9: The item neighbors of brand_575 are: ['B0000A200C']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm still not finding the correct item. Let me try a different approach. Instead of searching for the brand, let me search for the item directly using more specific keywords from the title. Let me try searching for "Hanes Men's Knit Pant" or similar.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Hanes Men's Knit Pant]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I have a new item ID (B00007J82Z) from searching "Hanes Men's Knit Pant". Let me check its title feature to confirm if this is the correct item.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00007J82Z, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B00007J82Z are: Sew Beautiful. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm still not finding the correct item. Let me try a different strategy. Instead of searching for the full title, let me search for "Hanes Elastic Waistband" which might be more specific to the item in question.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[Hanes Elastic Waistband]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_644.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm consistently getting brand_644 when searching for various combinations of the item title. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable by its full title, or there might be an issue with the indexing. Let me try to find the item by first identifying the correct brand and then exploring its items. Since "Hanes" is a brand, let me find all brands with "Hanes" in their name.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Hanes brand]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_575.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm not making progress with direct searches. Let me try a different approach. Since the question mentions "Hanes Men's Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband" as an item, but I keep getting brand nodes, perhaps I should look for items that have "Hanes" in their title and then check if any match the description. Let me search for items with "Hanes" in their title.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[item Hanes]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_307.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to search for items. This suggests that the RetrieveNode function might be prioritizing brand nodes over item nodes when the keyword matches. Let me try a different approach. Since the question is about finding an item that has over 4 "bought_together_item" neighbors with the Hanes pants, I need to first find the correct item node. Let me try searching with a more unique part of the title: "Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband".
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Knit Pant with Elastic Waistband]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
