Question: What is the count of co-viewed items for item Exofficio Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Top?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the count of co-viewed items for item Exofficio Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Top? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the count of co-viewed items for a specific item. "Co-viewed items" likely refers to "also_viewed_item" neighbors. First, I need to find the node for the item "Exofficio Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Top".
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Exofficio Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Top]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_883.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_883" as the node ID, but this seems unusual because the item name should correspond to an item node, not a brand node. Let me verify this by checking the node features to confirm what type of node this is.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeFeature[brand_883, name]
Observation 2: The name feature of brand_883 are: Cowgirl Magazine. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The node ID "brand_883" appears to be a brand node (with name "Cowgirl Magazine"), not the item node I was looking for. This suggests that the initial retrieval might have been incorrect or there might be a mismatch. I should try to retrieve the item node again with a more precise query or check if there's a similar item node.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Exofficio Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Top]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_883.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node instead of the expected item node. This suggests that the item "Exofficio Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Top" might not exist in the graph, or there might be an issue with the retrieval. However, since the question specifically asks about this item, I should try alternative approaches. Perhaps I need to search for partial matches or check if there are similar item nodes that might contain this title.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Exofficio Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_848.
Thought 5: Thought 5: This is still returning brand nodes. Let me try a different approach. Since the item name is long, perhaps I should search for "Exofficio" items first, then look for the specific one.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Exofficio]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_736.
Thought 6: Thought 6: This is still returning brand nodes. It seems that "Exofficio" is being interpreted as a brand name rather than part of an item title. I need to find a way to locate the specific item node. Perhaps I should look for items that have "Exofficio" in their title by checking the brand's item connections first.
Action 6: Thought 6: Since "Exofficio" appears to be a brand (based on the previous retrievals), I should first find the correct brand node for Exofficio, then look through its items to find the specific item "Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Top". Let me retrieve the brand node for Exofficio.
Observation 6: 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I need to find the brand node for Exofficio first, then look through its items to find the specific item. Let me retrieve the brand node with "Exofficio" in its name.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Exofficio]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_736.
Thought 8: Thought 8: Now that I have the brand node for Exofficio (brand_736), I should check its name to confirm, then look at all the items linked to this brand to find the specific item "Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Top".
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[brand_736, name]
Observation 8: The name feature of brand_736 are: Ediciones Conde Nast Sa. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The brand node retrieved for "Exofficio" has the name "Ediciones Conde Nast Sa", which doesn't match "Exofficio". This suggests that the retrieval might not be working as expected for this query. Perhaps "Exofficio" is not a brand in the graph, or the retrieval function is not finding the correct node. I should try a different approach: search for the item by its full title or a significant portion of it, but since previous attempts returned brand nodes, maybe I need to look for items that contain "Chica Cool Scoop Neck" or similar.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Chica Cool Scoop Neck]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00MZ7OSDQ.
Thought 10: Thought 10: Great! Now I have an item node ID (B00MZ7OSDQ) for "Chica Cool Scoop Neck". Let me verify this is the correct item by checking its title feature.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00MZ7OSDQ, title]
Observation 10: The title feature of B00MZ7OSDQ are: Hustler Best Of Beaver Hunt #36 Magazine 2014. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The title "Hustler Best Of Beaver Hunt #36 Magazine 2014" doesn't match the item I'm looking for. This suggests that the retrieval using "Chica Cool Scoop Neck" found a different item. I need to try a more specific query to find the exact item "Exofficio Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Top". Let me try retrieving with the full item name again, but perhaps the system has issues with long queries. I'll try a different portion of the title.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Exofficio Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I have a new node ID (B00007J82Z) from the retrieval. Let me verify if this is the correct item by checking its title feature.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00007J82Z, title]
Observation 12: The title feature of B00007J82Z are: Sew Beautiful. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The retrieved node has title "Sew Beautiful", which doesn't match the target item. This suggests that the retrieval function might not be working optimally for this specific item name. Let me try a different approach: search for "Exofficio Women's Chica" to see if I can get closer to the correct item.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode[Exofficio Women's Chica]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_245.
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes. This suggests that the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand matches or that the specific item "Exofficio Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Top" might not exist in the graph. However, since the question specifically asks about this item, I should try to find the closest match. Let me try searching for "Chica Cool Scoop Neck Top" which seems to be the most distinctive part of the item name.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Chica Cool Scoop Neck Top]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00MZ7OSDQ.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm getting the same node ID (B00MZ7OSDQ) as before, which has the title "Hustler Best Of Beaver Hunt #36 Magazine 2014" - clearly not the item I'm looking for. This suggests that the specific item "Exofficio Women's Chica Cool Scoop Neck Short Sleeve Top" might not exist in the graph. However, since the question asks about it, I should try to find if there are any items with similar names or if "Exofficio" exists as a brand that might have related items. Let me try to search for "Exofficio" as a brand name more specifically.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Exofficio brand]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_728.
Correct answer: 30
