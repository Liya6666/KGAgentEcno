Question: What is the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with Players Economy Foam Violin Shoulder Pad; 4/4-3/4 Violin?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with Players Economy Foam Violin Shoulder Pad; 4/4-3/4 Violin? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with a specific item ("Players Economy Foam Violin Shoulder Pad; 4/4-3/4 Violin"). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Players Economy Foam Violin Shoulder Pad; 4/4-3/4 Violin]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_555.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that the retrieved node ID is "brand_555", which appears to be a brand node rather than an item node. This suggests that the item title might not match exactly, or there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the item node again with a more precise or alternative query.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Players Economy Foam Violin Shoulder Pad 4/4-3/4 Violin]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_176.
Thought 3: Thought 3: I'm still getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve "Players Economy Foam Violin Shoulder Pad; 4/4-3/4 Violin". This suggests that the exact title might not be matching. Let me try a different approach by using a partial keyword search or a simplified version of the title.
Action 3: RetrieveNode[Economy Foam Violin Shoulder Pad]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_332.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve this specific item. This suggests that the item might not exist in the graph, or the title might be stored differently. Let me try a more general approach by searching for "Violin Shoulder Pad" to see if I can find related items.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Violin Shoulder Pad]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_555.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. This suggests that the graph might not have the exact item, or the retrieval function might be prioritizing brand nodes. Let me try a different approach - I'll search for "Players Economy Foam" which might be more specific to the brand or product line.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Players Economy Foam]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_176.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve this specific item. This suggests that either the item doesn't exist in the graph, or the retrieval function is matching brand names instead of item titles. Let me try a different approach - I'll search for "Violin Shoulder Pad" but specify that I'm looking for an item by adding "item" to the query, or try to find the brand first and then explore its items.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Players Economy Foam Violin Shoulder Pad]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_176.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item, which suggests that the exact item title might not be in the graph, or the retrieval function is matching brand names. Let me try a different approach - I'll work with the brand nodes I'm getting and see if I can find related items through the brand connections.
Action 7: Thought 7: Since I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the specific item, let me work with one of these brand nodes to find items related to that brand. I'll use the brand node ID I received (brand_176) and check what items are linked to this brand.
Observation 7: 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I need to find items associated with the brand "brand_176" to see if any of them match the description "Players Economy Foam Violin Shoulder Pad; 4/4-3/4 Violin". Let me check the items linked to this brand node.
Action 8: Action 8: NeighbourCheck[brand_176, item]
Observation 8: The item neighbors of brand_176 are: ['B00006K5RP']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: Now I have an item node ID 'B00006K5RP' associated with brand_176. I need to check if this item matches the description "Players Economy Foam Violin Shoulder Pad; 4/4-3/4 Violin" by examining its features.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00006K5RP, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B00006K5RP are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than a readable title. This suggests there might be an issue with how the feature is stored or retrieved. Let me try to get other features of this item to better identify it, such as description or category.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00006K5RP, description]
Observation 10: The description feature of B00006K5RP are: ['Focuses on the billiard industry and the professional tour.', '', '']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The description "Focuses on the billiard industry and the professional tour" doesn't match a violin shoulder pad item. This suggests that brand_176 might not be the correct brand for the violin accessory. Let me try a different approach. Since I'm consistently getting brand nodes when searching for violin-related terms, let me try to find the correct item by searching for "violin shoulder pad" in a different way or try to find other brands that might be related to musical instruments.
Action 11: Thought 11: I need to find the correct item node for "Players Economy Foam Violin Shoulder Pad; 4/4-3/4 Violin". Since direct retrieval isn't working, let me try to search for the brand "Players" first, as it might be a brand name, and then look for violin-related items under that brand.
