Question: Can you tell me the average cost of the items frequently bought with Hillbilly Deluxe?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you tell me the average cost of the items frequently bought with Hillbilly Deluxe? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the average cost of items frequently bought with "Hillbilly Deluxe". First, I need to identify what "Hillbilly Deluxe" refers to. It could be an item or a brand. Since the question mentions "items frequently bought with", it's likely referring to an item node. I should retrieve the node for "Hillbilly Deluxe".
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Hillbilly Deluxe]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_163.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation shows that "Hillbilly Deluxe" is actually a brand node (brand_163), not an item node. The question asks for items frequently bought with "Hillbilly Deluxe", which suggests we need to find items of this brand and then find what items are frequently bought with those items. I should first get all items belonging to this brand.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[brand_163, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbors of brand_163 are: ['B00006K60T']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The brand "Hillbilly Deluxe" has only one item: B00006K60T. Now I need to find items that are frequently bought with this item. The question mentions "frequently bought with", which likely corresponds to the "also_bought_item" or "bought_together_item" relationships. I should check both to see which one has items.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00006K60T, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00006K60T are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The also_bought_item neighbors are empty. Let me check the bought_together_item neighbors, as that might be what "frequently bought with" refers to.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B00006K60T, bought_together_item]
Observation 4: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00006K60T are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: Both "also_bought_item" and "bought_together_item" neighbors are empty for this item. Let me check if there are any other relationships that might indicate "frequently bought with" items. Perhaps I should check "also_viewed_item" or "buy_after_viewing_item" as alternatives, though they might not exactly match "frequently bought with".
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00006K60T, also_viewed_item]
Observation 5: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00006K60T are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: All the common relationship types for "frequently bought with" items are empty for this particular item. However, the question specifically asks for items frequently bought with "Hillbilly Deluxe", which we've identified as a brand. Since the brand only has one item and that item has no associated "frequently bought with" items, I should check if there might be another interpretation. Perhaps "Hillbilly Deluxe" could also be an item title? Let me try to search for it as an item node to be thorough.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Hillbilly Deluxe item]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_163.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieval still returns the brand node. It seems "Hillbilly Deluxe" only exists as a brand in this graph, not as an item. Since the brand has only one item (B00006K60T) and that item has no "also_bought_item" or "bought_together_item" neighbors, there are no items frequently bought with Hillbilly Deluxe. Therefore, I cannot calculate an average cost as there are no such items. I should confirm the title of the item to provide a complete answer.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00006K60T, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B00006K60T are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The title feature seems to be returning HTML code rather than a readable title. This might be an issue with the data. However, based on the previous observations, we have established that the brand "Hillbilly Deluxe" has only one item (B00006K60T) and that item has no "also_bought_item" or "bought_together_item" neighbors. Therefore, there are no items frequently bought with Hillbilly Deluxe, making it impossible to calculate an average cost. I should conclude with this information.
Action 8: Finish[There are no items frequently bought with Hillbilly Deluxe, so the average cost cannot be calculated.]
Observation 8: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 7.32
