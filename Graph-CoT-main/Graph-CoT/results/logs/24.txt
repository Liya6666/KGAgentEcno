Question: What is the price of item Trailer Trash?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the price of item Trailer Trash? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the price of an item called "Trailer Trash". First, I need to find the item node in the graph using its title.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Trailer Trash]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7YB.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID for the item "Trailer Trash", I need to retrieve its price feature.
Action 2: NodeFeature[B00005N7YB, price]
Observation 2: The price feature of B00005N7YB are: . 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The price feature returned empty. This might indicate that the price information is not directly available for this item node. I should check if there are other related nodes or if I need to look at the item's description or other features that might contain price information. Alternatively, I should verify if I have the correct node by checking its title feature.
Action 3: NodeFeature[B00005N7YB, title]
Observation 3: The title feature of B00005N7YB are: Camping Life. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The title feature returned "Camping Life", which doesn't match the query "Trailer Trash". This suggests that the initial retrieval might have been incorrect. I need to retrieve the correct node for "Trailer Trash" more precisely. Perhaps I should try a more specific search or check if there are multiple nodes with similar names.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[Trailer Trash item]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B000066T0T.
Thought 5: Thought 5: Now I have a different node ID (B000066T0T) for "Trailer Trash". I should verify if this is the correct node by checking its title feature to ensure it matches the query.
Action 5: NodeFeature[B000066T0T, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B000066T0T are: Military Vehicles (1-year). 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The title "Military Vehicles (1-year)" doesn't match "Trailer Trash" either. I need to try a different approach. Perhaps I should search for nodes that might contain "Trailer Trash" in their description or other features, or maybe the item is listed under a slightly different name. Let me try to search with a more specific query that might match the exact title.
Action 6: RetrieveNode["Trailer Trash" exact match]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00ATEFIA4.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I got another node ID (B00ATEFIA4) from the exact match search. I should check its title feature to confirm if this is the correct "Trailer Trash" item.
Action 7: NodeFeature[B00ATEFIA4, title]
Observation 7: The title feature of B00ATEFIA4 are: Us Weekly Magazine, Issue 934, January 7, 2013, What Tore Them Apart:bethenny &amp; Jason. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: None of the retrieved nodes so far have the title "Trailer Trash". I need to try a different strategy. Perhaps "Trailer Trash" is not the exact title but might be part of the description or another feature. I should search for nodes that might contain "Trailer Trash" in their description feature, or perhaps it's a brand name instead of an item title.
Action 8: Thought 8: Since direct retrieval by title isn't working, I should try to search for nodes that might have "Trailer Trash" in their description or other features. Alternatively, I could consider if "Trailer Trash" is actually a brand name rather than an item title.
Observation 8: 
Thought 9: Thought 9: Since direct retrieval by title isn't working, I should try to search for nodes that might have "Trailer Trash" in their description feature. Alternatively, I could consider if "Trailer Trash" is actually a brand name rather than an item title. Let me first try to search for nodes with "Trailer Trash" in the description.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[description: Trailer Trash]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7YB.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm getting the same node ID (B00005N7YB) again when searching by description. Let me check the description feature of this node to see if it contains "Trailer Trash" and potentially find price information there.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00005N7YB, description]
Observation 10: The description feature of B00005N7YB are: []. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The description feature is empty for this node. I need to try a different approach. Perhaps "Trailer Trash" is not an item title but a brand name. Let me try to search for it as a brand instead.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[brand: Trailer Trash]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_307.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I found a brand node with ID brand_307 for "Trailer Trash". Since the question is asking for the price of an item called "Trailer Trash", but I found it as a brand, I need to check if there are any items associated with this brand that might be the actual "Trailer Trash" product. Let me check the items linked to this brand.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[brand_307, item]
Observation 12: The item neighbors of brand_307 are: ['B00006KJPV']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I found that the brand "Trailer Trash" has one associated item with ID B00006KJPV. Since the question is asking for the price of an item called "Trailer Trash", this might be the actual product. I should check the title of this item to confirm it matches "Trailer Trash", and then get its price.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00006KJPV, title]
Observation 13: The title feature of B00006KJPV are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The title feature returned HTML code instead of a readable title. This suggests the data might be formatted differently. I should check if this item is indeed the "Trailer Trash" product by looking at its description or other features. Alternatively, I should directly check the price of this item since it's associated with the "Trailer Trash" brand.
Action 14: Action 14: NodeFeature[B00006KJPV, price]
Observation 14: The price feature of B00006KJPV are: . 
Thought 15: Thought 15: The price feature is still empty for this item. I should check the description feature of this item to see if it contains price information or confirms that this is the "Trailer Trash" product.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B00006KJPV, description]
Observation 15: The description feature of B00006KJPV are: ["<i>Jezebel</i> is the premiere guide to upscale, luxury living in Atlanta and beyond.
