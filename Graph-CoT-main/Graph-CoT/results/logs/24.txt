Question: How many co-viewed items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many co-viewed items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about co-viewed items for an item with a specific title containing HTML-like text. First, I need to find the item node in the graph using its title.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I have the node ID B00005N7NQ. The question asks for "co-viewed items" which likely refers to "also_viewed_item" neighbors. I need to find how many such neighbors this item has.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 24. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The question asks for "co-viewed items" and specifies to provide node main features (names) rather than node IDs. I need to get the actual titles of the also_viewed_item neighbors, not just the count. I should retrieve the list of these neighbors first.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I now have the list of also_viewed_item neighbor IDs. Since the question asks for node main features (names/titles) rather than node IDs, I need to retrieve the title feature for each of these item nodes. I should get the titles one by one or in batches to provide the complete list of co-viewed item names.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, title]
Observation 4: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I received an error when trying to get the title feature for node B000UHI2LW. This suggests that either the node ID is incorrect or I need to use a different approach. Since these are item nodes, they should have a "title" feature. Let me try to retrieve the node first to confirm it exists and get its proper ID.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I see the issue now. When I retrieved "B000UHI2LW" as a node, it returned "brand_756", which means B000UHI2LW is actually a brand node, not an item node. However, the also_viewed_item neighbors should be item nodes. This suggests there might be an inconsistency in the graph data or my understanding. Let me try a different approach - I'll check what type of node B00005N7NQ is first to better understand the situation.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 7: Thought 7: Now I understand the situation better. The item node B00005N7NQ has a title that contains HTML-like text. The also_viewed_item neighbors should be item nodes, but when I tried to get the title of one of them (B000UHI2LW), it seems to be a brand node. This might indicate that the graph has mixed node types in the neighbor lists. Let me try to get the features of one of the neighbor nodes to confirm their type.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, name]
Observation 7: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm encountering issues with the neighbor nodes. Let me try a different approach. Since B000UHI2LW was identified as a brand node (brand_756), I should check if it has a "name" feature instead of "title". Let me also verify the node type by checking what features are available for this node.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[brand_756, name]
Observation 8: The name feature of brand_756 are: TWOBIU. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: I see that B000UHI2LW is indeed a brand node (brand_756) with name "TWOBIU". However, the question is about "co-viewed items" (also_viewed_item neighbors), which should be item nodes, not brand nodes. There seems to be an inconsistency in the graph data where brand nodes are listed as also_viewed_item neighbors. Let me check if this pattern continues with other neighbors by trying to get the title feature of another neighbor from the list.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B002PXW18E, title]
Observation 9: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm encountering the same issue with another neighbor node. Let me try to retrieve B002PXW18E as a node to see if it's also a brand node, then check its features accordingly.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[B002PXW18E]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I see a pattern emerging. The also_viewed_item neighbors that were returned for item B00005N7NQ appear to be brand nodes rather than item nodes. This suggests there might be an issue with the graph structure or my understanding of the relationships. Let me verify this by checking what type of neighbors the also_viewed_item relationship should connect to according to the graph definition, and then try to get the actual item titles in a different way.
Action 11: Action 11: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 11: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm getting the same list of neighbors again. Since these appear to be brand nodes rather than item nodes (based on my previous attempts), and the question specifically asks for "co-viewed items" with their main features (names/titles), I need to find a way to get the actual item titles. Let me try to check if these nodes have "name" features instead of "title" features, since they might be brand nodes.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, name]
Observation 12: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm still encountering issues. Let me try using the brand node ID that was returned earlier (brand_756) to get its name feature, as this might be the correct way to access the brand information.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[brand_756, name]
Observation 13: The name feature of brand_756 are: TWOBIU. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I see that when I use the brand node ID (brand_756) directly, I can successfully retrieve the brand name. This confirms that the also_viewed_item neighbors are indeed brand nodes, not item nodes. However, this contradicts the graph definition which states that item nodes should be linked to "also_viewed_item nodes" (implying item nodes). The question asks for "co-viewed items" but the graph seems to have brand nodes as also_viewed_item neighbors. Since the question specifies to provide node main features (names) rather than node IDs, I should proceed by getting the names of all these brand nodes. Let me systematically retrieve the names of all the also_viewed_item neighbors by first getting their proper brand node IDs and then their names.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[B002PXW18E]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I need to systematically retrieve all the also_viewed_item neighbors and get their names. Since these appear to be brand nodes rather than item nodes, I should retrieve each one to get its proper brand node ID, then get the name feature for each brand node. Let me start by retrieving the first few neighbors to confirm this pattern.
Action 15: Thought 15: I need to systematically process all the also_viewed_item neighbors. Since these appear to be brand nodes rather than item nodes (contrary to the graph definition), I should retrieve each neighbor to get its proper brand node ID, then get the name feature for each. Let me start with the first few neighbors to confirm this pattern consistently.
Observation 15:
Correct answer: 27
