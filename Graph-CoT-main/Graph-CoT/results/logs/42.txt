Question: How many buy-after-viewing items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many buy-after-viewing items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of buy-after-viewing items for a specific item. However, the item name appears to be incomplete or possibly corrupted - it shows "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"" which looks like HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to first identify the correct item node.
Action 1: Thought 1: The item name provided appears to be HTML code rather than a proper item title. This might be an error in the question. I should try to retrieve the node using the given text as is, but it's likely this won't match any actual item node in the graph.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: The provided item name appears to be HTML code rather than a proper item title. This suggests there might be an error in the question formatting. However, I should attempt to retrieve the node using the exact text provided, though it's unlikely to match a real item node. If that fails, I'll need to reconsider the approach.

Action 4: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I successfully retrieved a node with ID B00005N7NQ using the provided text. Now I need to verify that this is indeed the correct item node by checking its title feature to confirm it matches the intended item.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The retrieved node has a title that exactly matches the provided text, confirming this is the correct item node. The question asks for the number of buy-after-viewing items, but specifically requests the answer to provide node main features (names) rather than just the count. This means I need to first find the number of buy-after-viewing items, then retrieve their titles.
Action 6: Thought 6: The question asks for the number of buy-after-viewing items, but specifically requests to provide node main features (names) rather than just the count. This means I need to first find the buy-after-viewing neighbors, then retrieve their titles to count them and provide the names.
Observation 6: 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I need to find the buy-after-viewing items for this node. First, I should check what buy-after-viewing neighbors this item has using the NeighbourCheck function.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 7: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: []. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The observation shows that this item has no buy_after_viewing_item neighbors (empty list). This means there are 0 buy-after-viewing items for this item. Since the question asks for the number and to provide node main features (names), but there are no such items, the answer should simply be 0 with no names to list.
Action 8: Thought 8: The item has no buy_after_viewing_item neighbors, so the number is 0. Since there are no such items, there are no names to provide. The answer should reflect this.
