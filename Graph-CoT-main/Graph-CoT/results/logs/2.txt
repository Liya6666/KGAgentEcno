Question: Could you specify the brand of Blackberry Playbook 7-Inch Tablet (64GB)?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Could you specify the brand of Blackberry Playbook 7-Inch Tablet (64GB)? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the brand of a specific item node (Blackberry Playbook 7-Inch Tablet (64GB)). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Blackberry Playbook 7-Inch Tablet (64GB)]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_528" as the node ID, but the question is about an item (Blackberry Playbook 7-Inch Tablet), not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should try retrieving the item node again with a more precise query or check if there's a mismatch.
Action 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_528" as the node ID, but the question is about an item (Blackberry Playbook 7-Inch Tablet), not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. I should try retrieving the item node again with a more precise query or check if there's a mismatch. Perhaps the title needs to be adjusted, or maybe the node exists under a slightly different name.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation from Action 1 seems incorrect - it returned a brand node ID for what should be an item query. I need to try retrieving the item node with a more specific or alternative query. Perhaps the full title is too long, so I should try a shorter version or keywords.
Action 3: RetrieveNode[Blackberry Playbook 7-Inch Tablet 64GB]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 4: Thought 4: This is still returning a brand node ID, which suggests there might be an issue with how the item is stored in the graph. Perhaps the item node has a different title, or maybe I need to search with different keywords. Let me try retrieving with just "Blackberry Playbook" to see if that helps.
Action 4: RetrieveNode[Blackberry Playbook]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 5: Thought 5: It seems that retrieving with "Blackberry Playbook" related queries consistently returns a brand node (brand_528) instead of an item node. This might indicate that the item node has a different title or that the graph has a different structure. Perhaps I should check what the brand_528 node represents to understand the context better.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[brand_528, name]
Observation 5: The name feature of brand_528 are: Tablet Publ Co. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The brand_528 node has the name "Tablet Publ Co", which doesn't seem to match Blackberry. This suggests that the retrieval might be incorrect. Perhaps the item node has a different title format. Let me try retrieving with a more specific query including "64GB" and "BlackBerry" (with proper capitalization).
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[BlackBerry PlayBook 7-Inch Tablet 64GB]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node instead of an item node, which suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with these queries. Perhaps I need to approach this differently. Since the question is about finding the brand of a specific item, maybe I should look for items related to Blackberry Playbook and then find their brand. Alternatively, I could check what items are linked to the brand_528 node to see if any match the description.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[brand_528, item]
Observation 7: The item neighbors of brand_528 are: ['B00007LOKX']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: Now I have found an item node ID ('B00007LOKX') that is linked to brand_528. I should check the features of this item node to see if it matches the description "Blackberry Playbook 7-Inch Tablet (64GB)".
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00007LOKX, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B00007LOKX are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title feature returned HTML code instead of a readable title. This suggests there might be an issue with how the title is stored. Let me try checking other features like description to confirm if this is the correct item.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00007LOKX, description]
Observation 9: The description feature of B00007LOKX are: ['A source of progressive, responsible Catholic thinking. Contains articles and international Church news, special reports and analysis of official church documents, editorial comment, book reviews, art and more. Rich in history and published weekly in the UK.']. 
Thought 10: Thought 10: The description of item B00007LOKX is about a Catholic publication, not a Blackberry Playbook tablet. This clearly indicates that this is not the correct item. The retrieval of "Blackberry Playbook" queries consistently returning brand_528 suggests there might be an error in the graph or retrieval function. Since I cannot find the specific item node, I should try to find if there are other item nodes that might be related to Blackberry Playbook by searching with different keywords or checking other brands.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[BlackBerry PlayBook 64GB]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 11: Thought 11: The retrieval is consistently returning brand_528 for all Blackberry Playbook related queries, which appears to be incorrect based on the item description I found. This suggests there might be a data issue in the graph. However, since the question specifically asks about "Blackberry Playbook 7-Inch Tablet (64GB)", I should try a different approach. Let me search for items that might contain "Playbook" in their title to see if I can find the correct item.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Playbook 64GB]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Thought 12: Thought 12: The retrieval is still returning brand_528, which seems to be a persistent issue. This suggests that the graph might have a problem with how these queries are being processed, or the item node might not exist with the exact title. Since I need to find the brand for this specific item, I should try to find any item nodes that might be related to Blackberry by checking other brands or using different search strategies. Let me try to retrieve with just "Blackberry" to see if there are other brand nodes.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[Blackberry]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_294.
Thought 13: Thought 13: Now I have a different brand node (brand_294) when searching for "Blackberry". This might be the correct brand for Blackberry products. Let me check the name of this brand to confirm.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[brand_294, name]
Observation 13: The name feature of brand_294 are: Kbs Communications. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The brand_294 has the name "Kbs Communications", which doesn't seem to match Blackberry either. This suggests that the graph might not have the specific Blackberry Playbook item or the retrieval is not working as expected. However, since the question specifically asks about "Blackberry Playbook 7-Inch Tablet (64GB)", I should try to find if there are any item nodes that might contain "Playbook" or "BlackBerry" in their features. Let me try to retrieve with "BlackBerry" (with proper capitalization) to see if that yields different results.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[BlackBerry]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_294.
Thought 15: Thought 15: The retrieval for "BlackBerry" still returns brand_294 (Kbs Communications), which doesn't seem correct for the BlackBerry brand. This suggests there might be a data issue in the graph where BlackBerry-related items and brands are not properly indexed. Since I cannot find the specific item node through direct retrieval, I should try a different approach. Let me search for items that might be tablets or electronics to see if I can find the BlackBerry Playbook indirectly.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Tablet 64GB]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_528.
Correct answer: BlackBerry
