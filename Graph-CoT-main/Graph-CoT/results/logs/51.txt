Question: What is the number of items bought after viewing item Nonlocality And The Observer, A New Model For Your World?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the number of items bought after viewing item Nonlocality And The Observer, A New Model For Your World? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the number of items that are bought after viewing the item "Nonlocality And The Observer, A New Model For Your World". First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Nonlocality And The Observer, A New Model For Your World]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007B051.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the number of items that are bought after viewing this item. This means I need to count the "buy_after_viewing_item" neighbors of this node. I should use NodeDegree to get the count.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00007B051, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 2: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbor node degree of B00007B051 are: 0. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The NodeDegree returned 0, which means there are no items that were bought after viewing this specific item. However, I should double-check if this is accurate by looking at the actual neighbors to confirm there are indeed no buy_after_viewing_item connections.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00007B051, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 3: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00007B051 are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The NeighbourCheck confirms that there are no buy_after_viewing_item neighbors for this item. Therefore, the number of items bought after viewing "Nonlocality And The Observer, A New Model For Your World" is 0.
Action 4: Finish[0]
Observation 4: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 0
