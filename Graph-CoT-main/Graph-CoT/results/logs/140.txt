Question: What is the average number of also-bought items for magazines in category Military Science?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the average number of also-bought items for magazines in category Military Science? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the average number of also-bought items for magazines in the category "Military Science". First, I need to find all item nodes that are magazines and have the category "Military Science". Then, for each of these items, I need to find the number of also_bought_item neighbors. Finally, I'll calculate the average of these numbers.
Action 1: Thought 1: I need to find all item nodes that are magazines in the "Military Science" category. Since I don't have a direct way to search by category, I'll need to first find some magazine items in Military Science and then explore from there. Let me start by searching for "Military Science" items.
Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: I need to find items with category "Military Science". Since I can't directly search by category, I should first retrieve a node that might be related to "Military Science" magazines. Let me try searching for "Military Science magazine" to find relevant items.
