Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with a specific item. First, I need to identify the target item node from its title, which appears to be incomplete or malformed: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?". This might be an HTML fragment from a web page. I should try to retrieve the node using this exact string.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I have the target item node ID (B00005N7NQ). The question asks for items that share over 4 co-viewed items with this target. "Co-viewed items" likely refers to items that are also_viewed_item neighbors. I need to first find the also_viewed_item neighbors of the target item.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I now have the list of also_viewed_item neighbors for the target item. The question asks for items that share over 4 co-viewed items with the target. This means I need to find items that have more than 4 also_viewed_item neighbors in common with B00005N7NQ. I should check the also_viewed_item neighbors of each of these neighbors to find overlaps.
Action 3: Action 3: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 3: The also_viewed_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 24. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I know the target item has 24 also_viewed_item neighbors. Now I need to find which items share more than 4 of these co-viewed items with the target. I should check the also_viewed_item neighbors of each neighbor in the list from Observation 2, and count how many overlap with the target's also_viewed_item list. However, checking all 24 neighbors might be inefficient. Since the question asks for items that share over 4 co-viewed items, I should systematically check each neighbor's also_viewed_item list and count overlaps with the target's list.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B000UHI2LW, also_viewed_item]
Observation 4: The node or neighbor type does not exist in the graph. This might because your given neighbor type is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I see that "B000UHI2LW" might not be an item node, or the neighbor type might be incorrect. Let me first verify the node type and available neighbor types for the target item. I should check what neighbor types are available for the target item node.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00005N7NQ, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00005N7NQ are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I see that the title feature confirms this is indeed the correct node. The issue with Observation 4 might be that "B000UHI2LW" is not a valid item node ID, or perhaps I need to verify the neighbor types. Let me check what neighbor types are available for item nodes according to the graph definition. The definition states that item nodes are linked to brand, also_viewed_item, buy_after_viewing_item, also_bought_item, and bought_together_item nodes. So "also_viewed_item" should be correct. Perhaps the node ID "B000UHI2LW" is not an item node. Let me try to retrieve it first to verify.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 7: Thought 7: I see the issue now. "B000UHI2LW" is actually a brand node (brand_756), not an item node. Looking back at Observation 2, the also_viewed_item neighbors returned include both item nodes and brand nodes. However, "co-viewed items" should refer to item nodes only. I need to filter the also_viewed_item neighbors to only include actual item nodes, not brand nodes.
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, also_viewed_item]
Observation 7: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: ['B000UHI2LW', 'B002PXW18E', 'B002GCU2S0', 'B01AKS14AQ', 'B00005N7R5', 'B0025ZOVEO', 'B0047VIALE', 'B0032KHQTS', 'B0047VIAMS', 'B002PXW1NY', 'B002PXW17K', 'B0160CM16W', 'B0046Z4TZW', 'B000Y12576', 'B07JZJCL7F', 'B002PXVZ4K', 'B001THPA3K', 'B0061SHL02', 'B00EV5HI0K', 'B00005N7SD', 'B0061SHL2U', 'B01M0EY22O', 'B001TP73TG', 'B0160CN1YI']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I need to identify which of these neighbors are actually item nodes. I should check the type of each neighbor by retrieving them and checking their features. Since the question asks about "co-viewed items," I need to focus only on item nodes that are also_viewed_item neighbors. Let me start by checking the first few neighbors to see their types.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[B000UHI2LW]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I've confirmed that "B000UHI2LW" is a brand node (brand_756). I need to check the type of each neighbor in the list to identify which are actual item nodes. Let me check the next neighbor to see if it's an item node.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[B002PXW18E]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_411.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm finding that many of the also_viewed_item neighbors are actually brand nodes, not item nodes. This is confusing because the graph definition states that item nodes are linked to "also_viewed_item nodes," which suggests these should be item nodes. Let me check a few more to see if there are any actual item nodes in this list.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[B002GCU2S0]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_756.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm consistently finding that the "also_viewed_item" neighbors are being returned as brand nodes, which contradicts the graph definition. Let me reconsider the graph structure. Perhaps "also_viewed_item" refers to connections to other items, but the node IDs might be shared between item and brand nodes. Let me check if there are actual item nodes in this list by trying to retrieve their features to confirm their type.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00005N7R5, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B00005N7R5 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I see that "B00005N7R5" has a title feature similar to the target item, suggesting it might be an item node. Let me check if it has item-specific features like price or category to confirm it's an item node.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00005N7R5, price]
Observation 12: The price feature of B00005N7R5 are: . 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The price feature is empty, but the presence of a price feature suggests this is indeed an item node. Let me check another feature to confirm.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00005N7R5, category]
Observation 13: The category feature of B00005N7R5 are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Professional & Educational Journals', 'Professional & Trade', 'Humanities & Social Sciences', 'Economics & Economic Theory']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I've confirmed that "B00005N7R5" is an item node based on its category feature. Now I need to systematically identify which of the also_viewed_item neighbors from Observation 2 are actual item nodes versus brand nodes. I should check each neighbor's type by attempting to retrieve item-specific features like category or price. Once I have the list of actual item nodes that are co-viewed with the target, I can proceed to find which items share more than 4 of these co-viewed items.
Action 14: Thought 14: I need to identify all actual item nodes from the also_viewed_item neighbors list. I'll check each neighbor by attempting to retrieve its category feature - if it returns a valid category, it's an item node; if it returns an error or empty, it might be a brand node. Let me start with the first few neighbors.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: I need to systematically identify which of the also_viewed_item neighbors are actual item nodes. I'll check each neighbor by attempting to retrieve its category feature - if it returns a valid category, it's an item node. Let me start with the first neighbor.
Action 15: Action 15: NodeFeature[B000UHI2LW, category]
Observation 15: The node or feature name does not exist in the graph. This might because your given feature name is not correct. Please modify it.
Correct answer: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary", <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"
