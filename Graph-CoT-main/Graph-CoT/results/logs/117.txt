Question: How many items have identical frequently-purchased-together entries as item Febreze Oreck CC Bag?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items have identical frequently-purchased-together entries as item Febreze Oreck CC Bag? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items that have identical frequently-purchased-together entries as the item "Febreze Oreck CC Bag". First, I need to find the node for this item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Febreze Oreck CC Bag]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_395.
Thought 2: Thought 2: I notice that the retrieved node ID is "brand_395", which appears to be a brand node rather than an item node. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the item node more specifically by including more context from the item name.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Febreze Oreck CC Bag item]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_395.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node instead of an item node. This suggests that the item name might not be exact in the graph, or there might be a mismatch. Let me try to retrieve using a different approach - perhaps by looking for nodes with "Febreze" in their title, as that seems to be the key brand/product name.
Action 3: RetrieveNode[Febreze]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_840.
Thought 4: Thought 4: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "Febreze". This suggests that the item name might be stored differently in the graph. Let me try to retrieve the specific item with a more complete title, perhaps including "Oreck" which seems to be part of the product name.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Oreck CC Bag]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_148.
Thought 5: Thought 5: I'm consistently getting brand nodes instead of item nodes when trying to retrieve "Febreze Oreck CC Bag". This suggests that the item might not exist in the graph with that exact name, or there might be a different naming convention. Let me try to think about this differently - perhaps I should look for items that might be related to Febreze or Oreck brands and see if I can find the specific item that way.
Action 5: Thought 5: Since direct retrieval isn't working, I should try to find the item by first identifying the brand nodes for Febreze and Oreck, then look at their items to find the specific product.
Observation 5: 
Thought 6: Thought 6: I need to find the item "Febreze Oreck CC Bag" but direct retrieval isn't working. Let me try to find brand nodes first and then look for items. Let me search for the Febreze brand node.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Febreze brand]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_346.
Thought 7: Thought 7: Now I have a Febreze brand node (brand_346). Let me check what items are linked to this brand to see if I can find the specific item "Febreze Oreck CC Bag".
Action 7: Action 7: NeighbourCheck[brand_346, item]
Observation 7: The item neighbors of brand_346 are: ['B00006KW9R', 'B00006KYCL', 'B00007AWY5', 'B00007AVRP']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: I have four items from the Febreze brand. Now I need to check their titles to see if any of them match "Febreze Oreck CC Bag". Let me check the title feature for each of these items.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00006KW9R, title]
Observation 8: The title feature of B00006KW9R are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The title feature returned seems to be HTML code rather than the actual title text. This suggests that the feature might be stored differently than expected. Let me try to retrieve the title for another item from the Febreze brand to see if I can get the actual product name.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B00006KYCL, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B00006KYCL are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm getting HTML code instead of readable titles when checking the title feature. This suggests the feature might be stored as HTML. Let me try to check the description feature instead, which might contain the product name in a more readable format.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00006KW9R, description]
Observation 10: The description feature of B00006KW9R are: ['Covers the latest trends in design and architecture, plus practical design solutions.']. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The description doesn't seem to match a Febreze product. This suggests that the brand node I found might not be the correct Febreze brand. Let me try a different approach to find the correct item. Since the question mentions "frequently-purchased-together" entries, which likely refers to "bought_together_item" relationships, I need to find the specific item first. Let me try to search for "Oreck" as a brand instead.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Oreck brand]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_728.
Thought 12: Thought 12: I found an Oreck brand node (brand_728). Let me check what items are linked to this brand to see if I can find the specific "Febreze Oreck CC Bag" item.
Action 12: Action 12: NeighbourCheck[brand_728, item]
Observation 12: The item neighbors of brand_728 are: ['B000INCK4I', 'B005DNAMPM', 'B005DNA3LU', 'B005DNCFP2', 'B005DNCU20', 'B005DNB4SG']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I have several items from the Oreck brand. Let me check the title features of these items to see if any match "Febreze Oreck CC Bag". Since previous title features returned HTML, I'll try to check the description feature which might contain the product name.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B000INCK4I, description]
Observation 13: The description feature of B000INCK4I are: ['The favorite life-style magazine of country-loving women for 40 years is filled with delicious country recipes, affordable decorating ideas, easy-to-make crafts, green-thumb advice for your gardens and wholesome humor.']. 
Thought 14: Thought 14: The descriptions I'm getting don't seem to match vacuum or cleaning products, which suggests I might not have the correct brand nodes. Let me try a different approach. Since the question is about "frequently-purchased-together" entries (which likely corresponds to "bought_together_item" relationships), I should try to find the item by searching for "CC Bag" which might be more specific to the product.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[CC Bag]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_148.
Thought 15: Thought 15: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve "CC Bag". This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with the given name. Let me try a different approach - perhaps the item has a different name in the graph. Since the question is about frequently-purchased-together items (bought_together_item), I should look for items that might be related to Oreck vacuum bags or Febreze products. Let me try to search for "Oreck vacuum bag" or similar terms.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Oreck vacuum bag]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_319.
Correct answer: 4
