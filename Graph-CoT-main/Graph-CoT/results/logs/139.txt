Question: What is the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with Dahlia Women's 100% Long Silk Scarf - Wassily Kandinsky &quot;Houses in Munich&quot; - Red?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with Dahlia Women's 100% Long Silk Scarf - Wassily Kandinsky &quot;Houses in Munich&quot; - Red? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the typical cost of items that are often viewed together with a specific item (Dahlia Women's 100% Long Silk Scarf - Wassily Kandinsky "Houses in Munich" - Red). First, I need to find this item node in the graph.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Dahlia Women's 100% Long Silk Scarf - Wassily Kandinsky "Houses in Munich" - Red]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the items that are often viewed together with this item. According to the graph definition, items are linked to "also_viewed_item" nodes. I should get the list of these items.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00007J82Z, also_viewed_item]
Observation 2: The also_viewed_item neighbors of B00007J82Z are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that there are no also_viewed_item neighbors for this item. However, the question asks about items "often viewed together," which might correspond to other relationship types like "buy_after_viewing_item," "also_bought_item," or "bought_together_item." I should check these other relationship types to find items that are commonly associated with this scarf.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00007J82Z, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 3: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00007J82Z are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Since both "also_viewed_item" and "buy_after_viewing_item" returned empty lists, I should check the "also_bought_item" and "bought_together_item" relationships, as these might represent items that are commonly viewed or purchased together with the target item.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[B00007J82Z, also_bought_item]
Observation 4: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00007J82Z are: []. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: All the relationship checks for "also_viewed_item", "buy_after_viewing_item", and "also_bought_item" returned empty lists. I should check the remaining relationship type "bought_together_item" to see if there are any items that are commonly purchased with this scarf.
Action 5: Action 5: NeighbourCheck[B00007J82Z, bought_together_item]
Observation 5: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00007J82Z are: []. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: It appears that the item "Dahlia Women's 100% Long Silk Scarf - Wassily Kandinsky "Houses in Munich" - Red" has no neighbors of any type (also_viewed_item, buy_after_viewing_item, also_bought_item, bought_together_item). This suggests that there might be no items that are commonly viewed or purchased together with this scarf in the graph. However, the question asks for the typical cost of such items, so if there are no associated items, I cannot determine a typical cost. I should double-check if I have the correct item node by verifying its features to ensure it matches the question.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00007J82Z, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00007J82Z are: Sew Beautiful. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The title "Sew Beautiful" does not match the item name in the question. This indicates that the initial retrieval might have been incorrect. I should try to retrieve the node again with a more precise or alternative query, perhaps using part of the title or considering that the full title might be stored differently.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Dahlia Women's 100% Long Silk Scarf Wassily Kandinsky Houses in Munich Red]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_307.
Thought 8: Thought 8: The retrieval returned a brand node (brand_307) instead of an item node. This suggests that the exact title might not be matching. I should try to retrieve the node using a different approach, perhaps by using a partial match or checking if there's a similar item. Alternatively, I can look for items that have "Dahlia" and "Silk Scarf" in their title by trying a more general keyword search.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Dahlia Silk Scarf]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007J82Z.
Thought 9: Thought 9: The retrieval is still returning the same node ID (B00007J82Z) with title "Sew Beautiful", which doesn't match the scarf item. This suggests that the graph might not contain the exact item mentioned in the question, or it might be stored under a different title. Since I cannot find the correct item node, I cannot proceed to find its associated items or their typical costs. I should conclude that the information is not available in the graph.
Action 9: Based on the interactions with the graph, I was unable to locate the specific item node "Dahlia Women's 100% Long Silk Scarf - Wassily Kandinsky 'Houses in Munich' - Red" in the graph database. The retrieval attempts returned a node with the title "Sew Beautiful" (ID: B00007J82Z), which does not match the queried item. Subsequent attempts with variations of the query also did not yield the correct item node.
Observation 9: 
Thought 10: Finish[The specific item "Dahlia Women's 100% Long Silk Scarf - Wassily Kandinsky 'Houses in Munich' - Red" could not be found in the graph database, so the typical cost of items viewed together with it cannot be determined.]
