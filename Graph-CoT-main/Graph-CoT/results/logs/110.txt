Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking which item shares over 4 co-viewed items with a specific item. First, I need to identify the target item node from its title, which appears to be incomplete or malformed: "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?". This might be an HTML fragment rather than a proper item title. I should try to retrieve the node using this string as is.

Observation 1: 
Thought 2: Thought 2: The retrieval failed, likely because the item title contains HTML markup. I need to extract the actual item title from this string. Looking at the pattern, this appears to be an HTML span element with classes, but the actual item title might be missing. Perhaps this is a formatting error and the actual title comes after this HTML fragment. Let me try retrieving with just the visible text portion if available, or I may need to reconsider the approach. Since the question references "item <span class...", perhaps the item title is embedded in this HTML. Let me try to parse out what might be the actual title.

Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I notice that in the question, the item title appears to be incomplete HTML code rather than a proper item name. This might be a formatting issue in the question itself. Let me try to retrieve the node using just the recognizable text portion. The string "<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary"?" seems to be HTML markup, but perhaps the actual item title follows this pattern in the graph. I should try to retrieve using the full string as provided.
