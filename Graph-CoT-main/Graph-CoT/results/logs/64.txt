Question: How many items are in brand Doolittle Media Ltd?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items are in brand Doolittle Media Ltd? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the number of items associated with the brand "Doolittle Media Ltd". First, I need to find the brand node in the graph using its name.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Doolittle Media Ltd]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_486.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the brand node ID, I need to find how many items are linked to this brand. Since brand nodes are linked to their item nodes, I should check the number of item neighbors for this brand node.
Action 2: NodeDegree[brand_486, item]
Observation 2: The item neighbor node degree of brand_486 are: 3. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The question asks for the number of items in brand Doolittle Media Ltd, and I have found that there are 3 items. However, the instruction says to answer by providing node main features (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. So I should list the names of these 3 items to complete the answer.
Action 3: NeighbourCheck[brand_486, item]
Observation 3: The item neighbors of brand_486 are: ['B00007EO1M', 'B000LC56B0', 'B001E54B14']. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I have the IDs of the three item nodes linked to brand_486. Now I need to get the main feature (title) for each of these items to provide their names instead of IDs.
Action 4: NodeFeature[B00007EO1M, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00007EO1M are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The observation seems to contain HTML markup rather than the actual title. I need to get the proper title feature for this item node. Let me try again to get the title feature.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[B00007EO1M, title]
Observation 5: The title feature of B00007EO1M are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The title feature appears to be returning HTML markup instead of clean text. This might be an issue with how the feature is stored. Let me try getting the title feature for the other item nodes to see if they return proper titles.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B000LC56B0, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B000LC56B0 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 7: Thought 7: I'm consistently getting HTML markup instead of clean text when retrieving the title feature. This suggests that the title feature might be stored with HTML formatting. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I should check if there's another feature that might contain the item name, or try to extract the text from within the HTML span.
Action 7: Action 7: NodeFeature[B00007EO1M, description]
Observation 7: The description feature of B00007EO1M are: ["This monthly magazine covers all kinds of scale model aircraft - from state-of-the-art radio control, through control line, to free flight and even indoor. It's full of information on scale modelling techniques, all in full colour throughout.", '', '']. 
Thought 8: Thought 8: The description feature provides some text content but doesn't give me the actual title/name of the item. Let me try getting the category feature or see if there's another way to extract the title from the HTML markup. Since the instruction asks for node main features (names), I need to find a way to get clean item titles.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00007EO1M, category]
Observation 8: The category feature of B00007EO1M are: ['Magazine Subscriptions', 'Sports, Recreation &amp; Outdoors', 'Sports &amp; Leisure', 'Flying']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The category feature provides information about the item's categories but not the actual title/name. Since the title feature consistently returns HTML markup, I should try to extract the text content from within the HTML. Looking at the pattern, it seems the actual title might be contained within the span element. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I can check if there's a way to get the text content directly, or try to parse what might be the actual title from the available information.
Action 9: Action 9: NodeFeature[B001E54B14, title]
Observation 9: The title feature of B001E54B14 are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm consistently getting HTML markup instead of clean text for the title feature across all item nodes. This suggests that the title feature might be stored with HTML formatting. Since the instruction asks to provide node main features (names) rather than node IDs, I need to find a way to get the actual item names. Let me try checking if there's any text content within the HTML span or if there's another feature that might contain the item name. Alternatively, I could try to extract the text that would normally appear within such HTML elements.
Action 10: Thought 10: Since the title feature consistently returns HTML markup instead of clean text, I need to find an alternative way to get the item names. Let me check if there's any text content that might be associated with these HTML elements, or if I can infer the item names from other available information. Perhaps the actual title text is embedded within the HTML structure, or maybe I should check if there's a pattern in how these titles are stored.
Observation 10: 
Thought 11: Thought 11: I notice that the title feature consistently returns HTML markup instead of clean text. Let me try to see if there's actual text content within these HTML elements by examining the full feature more carefully. Perhaps the title is contained within the span element, and I need to look for the text content that would normally appear between the HTML tags.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00007EO1M, title]
Observation 11: The title feature of B00007EO1M are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 12: Thought 12: I'm consistently getting incomplete HTML markup for the title feature. The observation shows only the opening tag of a span element without any content. This suggests there might be an issue with how the title feature is stored or retrieved. Let me try a different approach - perhaps I should check if there's another feature that might contain the item name, or if I can get more complete information about these items.
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[B00007EO1M, description]
Observation 12: The description feature of B00007EO1M are: ["This monthly magazine covers all kinds of scale model aircraft - from state-of-the-art radio control, through control line, to free flight and even indoor. It's full of information on scale modelling techniques, all in full colour throughout.", '', '']. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: I'm still not getting the actual item names/titles. The title feature consistently returns incomplete HTML markup. Let me try to check if there's a way to get the text content that would normally appear within these HTML elements. Perhaps I need to look at the full structure of the title feature or check if there's additional content that's not being displayed. Let me try to get more detailed information about the title feature structure.
Action 13: Action 13: NodeFeature[B00007EO1M, title]
Observation 13: The title feature of B00007EO1M are: <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary". 
Thought 14: Thought 14: I'm consistently getting incomplete HTML markup for the title feature across all item nodes. Since the instruction asks to provide node main features (names) rather than node IDs, but the title feature appears to be malformed or incomplete in the graph data, I need to find an alternative approach. Let me check if there's any other feature that might contain the item name, or if I can extract meaningful information from the available data. Since I have the item IDs and know there are 3 items, but cannot retrieve proper titles due to data issues, I should provide the count along with the available information.
Action 14: Thought 14: Since I cannot retrieve proper item titles due to the title feature returning incomplete HTML markup, I should provide the count of items (which is 3) and mention that the item titles are not properly retrievable from the graph data. The question asks for the number of items and to provide node main features (names), but given the data limitations, I'll provide the count and note the issue.
Observation 14: 
Thought 15: Thought 15: Based on my attempts, I've determined that there are 3 items associated with brand Doolittle Media Ltd (brand_486). However, the title feature for these items consistently returns incomplete HTML markup (<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary") without the actual text content. Since I cannot retrieve proper item names due to this data issue, I'll provide the count and note the limitation.
Action 15: Finish[There are 3 items in brand Doolittle Media Ltd. However, the item titles cannot be properly retrieved as the title feature returns incomplete HTML markup in the graph data.]
Observation 15: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 3
