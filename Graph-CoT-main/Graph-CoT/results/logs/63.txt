Question: How many items does Tangoes Junior have in its also-bought section?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many items does Tangoes Junior have in its also-bought section? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the "also-bought section" of Tangoes Junior, which likely refers to the number of also_bought_item neighbors. First, I need to find the node for Tangoes Junior. Since Tangoes Junior sounds like a brand name, I should retrieve the brand node.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[Tangoes Junior]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_468.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The question asks about the "also-bought section" of Tangoes Junior. Since Tangoes Junior is a brand (brand_468), and the question mentions "items" in its also-bought section, I need to understand what this means. Typically, also_bought_item relationships are between item nodes, not directly from brand nodes. I should check if the brand node has any also_bought_item neighbors or if I need to look at its items first.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[brand_468, also_bought_item]
Observation 2: The node or neighbor type does not exist in the graph. This might because your given neighbor type is not correct. Please modify it.
Thought 3: Thought 3: Since the brand node doesn't have direct also_bought_item neighbors (as expected, since also_bought relationships are between items), I need to approach this differently. The question is asking about "items in its also-bought section" for Tangoes Junior. This likely means I need to find all items from the Tangoes Junior brand, and then for each of those items, find their also_bought_item neighbors. However, this might be too broad. Alternatively, the question might be referring to a specific item called "Tangoes Junior" rather than a brand. Let me try retrieving "Tangoes Junior" as an item instead.
Action 3: Action 3: RetrieveNode[Tangoes Junior] (as an item)
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_468.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval still returns brand_468, suggesting that "Tangoes Junior" is indeed a brand node, not an item node. However, the question asks about "items in its also-bought section," which might be ambiguous. Perhaps "Tangoes Junior" refers to a specific product (item) with that name, but the graph doesn't have it as an item. Alternatively, the question might mean: for the brand Tangoes Junior, how many unique items are in the also_bought sections of all its products? But that seems complex. Let me first check what items belong to the brand Tangoes Junior.
Action 4: Action 4: NeighbourCheck[brand_468, item]
Observation 4: The item neighbors of brand_468 are: ['B00007AXUW']. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The brand Tangoes Junior has only one item: B00007AXUW. Now, the question is asking about "items in its also-bought section" - this likely refers to the also_bought_item neighbors of this specific item. I need to find how many also_bought_item neighbors this item has.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeDegree[B00007AXUW, also_bought_item]
Observation 5: The also_bought_item neighbor node degree of B00007AXUW are: 0. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The item B00007AXUW has 0 also_bought_item neighbors. However, this seems unusual. Let me verify this by checking the neighbors directly to ensure there are no also_bought_item connections.
Action 6: Action 6: NeighbourCheck[B00007AXUW, also_bought_item]
Observation 6: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00007AXUW are: []. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The item B00007AXUW has no also_bought_item neighbors. However, the question asks for "items in its also-bought section" and specifies to answer with node main features (names) rather than IDs. Since there are no also_bought_item neighbors, the answer should be 0. But let me double-check if there might be other relationships or if I misinterpreted the question. The question says "Tangoes Junior" and based on the graph, it's a brand with one item that has no also_bought items. Therefore, the number is 0.
Action 7: Action 7: Finish[0]
Observation 7: Answer is INCORRECT
Correct answer: 143
