Question: What is the mean cost of the items typically purchased with Neuma Volume Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: What is the mean cost of the items typically purchased with Neuma Volume Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking for the mean cost of items typically purchased with "Neuma Volume Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce". This likely refers to items that are "also_bought" or "bought_together" with this item. First, I need to find the node for this specific item.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Neuma Volume Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_848.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_848" as the ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the item node again with a more precise query or check if there's a mistake.
Action 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_848" as the ID, but the question is about an item, not a brand. This suggests there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to retrieve the item node again with a more precise query or check if there's a mistake. I should try to retrieve using the full title more carefully.
Observation 2: 
Thought 3: Thought 3: I need to retrieve the correct item node. The previous retrieval returned a brand node, which is incorrect. Let me try to retrieve the item node with the exact title: "Neuma Volume Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce".
Action 3: RetrieveNode[Neuma Volume Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce]
Observation 3: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_848.
Thought 4: Thought 4: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node instead of an item node. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with this title, or there might be a mismatch. Let me try to retrieve the item by searching for keywords from the title, such as "Neuma Volume Conditioner" or check if there's a different phrasing.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Neuma Volume Conditioner]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_848.
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieval is still returning a brand node. This suggests that "Neuma" might be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me check the features of this brand node to confirm and see if it has associated items.
Action 5: Action 5: NodeFeature[brand_848, name]
Observation 5: The name feature of brand_848 are: Massage Magazine. 
Thought 6: Thought 6: The brand node "brand_848" has the name "Massage Magazine", which doesn't match "Neuma". This indicates that the retrieval is incorrect. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the item title is slightly different. Let me try retrieving with "Neuma" and "Conditioner" separately or look for items related to hair care.
Action 6: Action 6: RetrieveNode[Neuma Volume Conditioner 8.5 Fluid Ounce]
Observation 6: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_848.
Thought 7: Thought 7: The retrieval is consistently returning "brand_848" with name "Massage Magazine", which is clearly incorrect for this query. This suggests there might be an issue with the item not being in the graph or the title being different. Let me try to search for items that might contain "Neuma" or "Conditioner" in their title by using partial keywords or checking if there are any items linked to a brand named "Neuma".
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[Neuma]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_375.
Thought 8: Thought 8: The retrieval for "Neuma" returned brand_375. Let me check the name of this brand to see if it matches "Neuma".
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[brand_375, name]
Observation 8: The name feature of brand_375 are: Tutto Scuola. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The retrieval for "Neuma" returned brand_375 with name "Tutto Scuola", which doesn't match. This suggests that "Neuma" might not be a brand in this graph, or the item might be listed under a different name. Let me try searching for "Volume Conditioner" or "Conditioner" to find related items.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Volume Conditioner]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_493.
Thought 10: Thought 10: The retrieval is consistently returning brand nodes instead of item nodes, which suggests that the specific item "Neuma Volume Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce" might not be directly retrievable with these queries. Since the question is about items typically purchased with this product, I need to find the item node first. Let me try a different approach: search for items that contain "Conditioner" in their title to see if I can find the specific Neuma product.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Conditioner]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_848.
Thought 11: Thought 11: The retrieval is consistently returning brand nodes, which indicates that the direct keyword matching isn't working for finding this specific item. This suggests that the item might not exist in the graph with this exact title, or there might be a different approach needed. Since the question asks for items typically purchased with this product, I should look for any item nodes that might be related to hair care or conditioners, but this seems inefficient. Let me try to search for the brand "Neuma" more specifically, as it might be a brand name, and then find its items.
Action 11: Action 11: RetrieveNode[Neuma brand]
Observation 11: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_728.
Thought 12: Thought 12: The retrieval for "Neuma brand" returned brand_728. Let me check the name of this brand to see if it matches "Neuma".
Action 12: Action 12: NodeFeature[brand_728, name]
Observation 12: The name feature of brand_728 are: Trusted Media Brands, Inc.. 
Thought 13: Thought 13: The retrievals are consistently returning brand nodes that don't match "Neuma". This suggests that either the specific item "Neuma Volume Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce" is not in the graph, or it might be listed under a different name. Since the question is about items typically purchased with this product, and I cannot find the specific item, I should consider that this might be a test case where the item exists but needs to be found through a different method. Let me try to search for items with "Volume Conditioner" or similar terms in their title by checking if there are any item nodes that might contain these words. However, since the RetrieveNode function seems to only return exact matches and is returning brands, I might need to approach this differently. Perhaps the item is in the graph but with a slightly different title. Let me try to retrieve the item using the full title with exact punctuation.
Action 13: Action 13: RetrieveNode["Neuma Volume Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce"]
Observation 13: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_848.
Thought 14: Thought 14: The retrieval is consistently returning brand nodes instead of the item node, which suggests that the specific item "Neuma Volume Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce" might not be directly retrievable with these queries. Since the question is about items typically purchased with this product, I need to find the item node first. Let me try a different approach: search for items that might be related to this product by looking for items with similar features or by checking if there are any items linked to brands that might be associated with hair care products. However, given the constraints, I might need to assume that the item exists and proceed with the ID if it were available. Since this is a simulated environment, let me try to use the item ID directly if it's known or try to find it through other means.
Action 14: Action 14: RetrieveNode[Neuma Volume Conditioner 8.5 oz]
Observation 14: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_848.
Thought 15: Thought 15: The retrieval attempts are consistently returning brand nodes instead of the item node, which suggests that the specific item "Neuma Volume Conditioner, 8.5 Fluid Ounce" might not be directly retrievable with these queries. Since the question is about items typically purchased with this product, I need to find the item node first. Let me try a different approach: search for items that might be related to this product by looking for items with "Conditioner" in their category or description, but since I can't directly retrieve the item, I might need to assume that the item exists and proceed with a hypothetical ID. However, given the constraints, I should try to find any item nodes that are conditioners or hair care products to see if I can find the Neuma product.
Action 15: Action 15: RetrieveNode[Neuma hair care]
Observation 15: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00007KGJT.
