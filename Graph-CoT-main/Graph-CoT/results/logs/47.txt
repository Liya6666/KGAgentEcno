Question: Can you tell me the quantity of items typically purchased alongside When War Comes?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: Can you tell me the quantity of items typically purchased alongside When War Comes? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about items typically purchased alongside "When War Comes". This likely refers to "bought_together_item" neighbors. First, I need to find the item node for "When War Comes".
Action 1: RetrieveNode[When War Comes]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00G2GWEZU.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now I need to find the items that are typically purchased alongside this item, which would be the "bought_together_item" neighbors. I should use NeighbourCheck to get these neighbors.
Action 2: Action 2: NeighbourCheck[B00G2GWEZU, bought_together_item]
Observation 2: The bought_together_item neighbors of B00G2GWEZU are: []. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that there are no bought_together_item neighbors for this item. However, the question asks about items "typically purchased alongside" which might also refer to "also_bought_item" neighbors. I should check those as well.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00G2GWEZU, also_bought_item]
Observation 3: The also_bought_item neighbors of B00G2GWEZU are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: Both "bought_together_item" and "also_bought_item" neighbors are empty for this item. This suggests that either there are no items typically purchased alongside "When War Comes", or the question might be misinterpreted. Let me check if there are any other relevant neighbor types that could indicate items purchased alongside, such as "buy_after_viewing_item" or "also_viewed_item". Alternatively, I should verify the node features to ensure we have the correct item.
Action 4: Action 4: NodeFeature[B00G2GWEZU, title]
Observation 4: The title feature of B00G2GWEZU are: Time Magazine October 28, 2013. 
Thought 5: Thought 5: The retrieved node has the title "Time Magazine October 28, 2013", which doesn't match "When War Comes". This suggests I may have retrieved the wrong node. I should try to retrieve the node with a more specific query that includes "When War Comes".
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[When War Comes book]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00CHQTE5C.
Thought 6: Thought 6: Now I have a different node ID (B00CHQTE5C) for "When War Comes". I should verify this is the correct item by checking its title feature.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[B00CHQTE5C, title]
Observation 6: The title feature of B00CHQTE5C are: Mother Jones Magazine [November 1983] Why are we still in Vietnam?. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: This still doesn't seem to be the correct "When War Comes" item. Let me try a different approach and search for the exact title "When War Comes" to ensure I get the right node.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode["When War Comes" exact title]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00CHQTE5C.
Thought 8: Thought 8: The retrieval keeps returning the same node ID (B00CHQTE5C) with a title that doesn't match "When War Comes". This suggests that the exact title "When War Comes" might not exist in the graph, or there might be an issue with the retrieval. Let me try to search with a different keyword or check if "When War Comes" is part of the description or another feature.
Action 8: Action 8: NodeFeature[B00CHQTE5C, description]
Observation 8: The description feature of B00CHQTE5C are: ['Publisher: Foundation for Progress. Page count: 60 pages. Articles in this issue include: Why are we still in Vietnam?; What Now, Willy Loman?; All in the Family; Rerunning the War; Losing Vietnam, Finding Vietnam; An Actor Turns Activist (Edward James Olmos); Rerunning the War; Intrusive Memories; Seizing History; Agent Orange: A Family Album.']. 
Thought 9: Thought 9: The description doesn't mention "When War Comes" either. Let me try a different retrieval approach. Perhaps "When War Comes" is not the exact title but part of it, or it might be in a different format. I should try searching with just "When War Comes" without additional words.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[When War Comes]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00G2GWEZU.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm getting inconsistent results with the retrieval. Let me try a different strategy - I'll check if there are any items that have "When War Comes" in their title by examining the features of the nodes I've retrieved. Since both retrieved nodes seem to be magazine issues, perhaps "When War Comes" is not a standalone item but part of a magazine title or description. Let me check the category feature of the first retrieved node to understand what type of item it is.
Action 10: Action 10: NodeFeature[B00G2GWEZU, category]
Observation 10: The category feature of B00G2GWEZU are: []. 
Thought 11: Thought 11: The category is empty for this node. Let me try checking the category of the other node I retrieved (B00CHQTE5C) to see if it provides more context.
Action 11: Action 11: NodeFeature[B00CHQTE5C, category]
Observation 11: The category feature of B00CHQTE5C are: []. 
Thought 12: Thought 12: Since direct retrieval isn't yielding the correct "When War Comes" item, I should consider that "When War Comes" might be part of a longer title or description. Let me try to search for items that might contain "When War Comes" in their description or title by using a broader search term. Alternatively, I can check if there are any items with "war" in the title that might be relevant.
Action 12: Action 12: RetrieveNode[war]
Observation 12: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00CHQTE5C.
Thought 13: Thought 13: The retrieval is consistently returning the same nodes, which don't seem to match "When War Comes" as a standalone item. This suggests that "When War Comes" might not be a complete title in the graph, or it might be part of a larger title or description. Since the question specifically asks about items purchased alongside "When War Comes", and I cannot find a matching item node, I should conclude that there is no item with the exact title "When War Comes" in the graph, and therefore no associated purchased-alongside items.
Action 13: Based on the interactions with the graph, I was unable to find an item node with the exact title "When War Comes". The retrieval attempts consistently returned nodes with titles like "Time Magazine October 28, 2013" and "Mother Jones Magazine [November 1983] Why are we still in Vietnam?", which do not match the query. Since no matching item node exists in the graph, there are no items typically purchased alongside "When War Comes".
