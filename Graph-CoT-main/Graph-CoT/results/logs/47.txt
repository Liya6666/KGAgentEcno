Question: How many buy-after-viewing items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many buy-after-viewing items does item <span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary" have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about the number of buy-after-viewing items for an item with a specific title. However, the title provided ("<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary") appears to be HTML code rather than a proper item title. I need to first retrieve the node using this title as it appears in the graph.
Action 1: Action 1: RetrieveNode[<span class="a-size-medium a-color-secondary]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is B00005N7NQ.
Thought 2: Thought 2: Now that I have the node ID (B00005N7NQ), I need to find out how many buy-after-viewing items this item has. I should use the NodeDegree function to count the number of buy_after_viewing_item neighbors.
Action 2: Action 2: NodeDegree[B00005N7NQ, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 2: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbor node degree of B00005N7NQ are: 0. 
Thought 3: Thought 3: The observation shows that the item has 0 buy_after_viewing_item neighbors. However, the question asks to provide the answer using node main features (names) rather than just the count. Since there are no buy-after-viewing items, I should confirm this by checking the neighbors directly to ensure there are indeed none.
Action 3: Action 3: NeighbourCheck[B00005N7NQ, buy_after_viewing_item]
Observation 3: The buy_after_viewing_item neighbors of B00005N7NQ are: []. 
Thought 4: Thought 4: The observations confirm that the item has no buy-after-viewing items. Since there are no neighbors to list, the answer should simply state that there are 0 buy-after-viewing items. The question asks to provide node main features (names) rather than node IDs, but since there are no items to name, the answer can be straightforward.
Action 4: Finish[0]
Observation 4: Answer is CORRECT
Correct answer: 0
