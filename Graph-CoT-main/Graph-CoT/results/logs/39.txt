Question: How many co-viewed items does item Microsoft Excel VBA Professional Projects have?
Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Interaction with Graph, Feedback from Graph steps. In Thought step, you can think about what further information is needed, and In Interaction step, you can get feedback from graphs with four functions: 
(1) RetrieveNode[keyword], which retrieves the related node from the graph according to the corresponding query.
(2) NodeFeature[Node, feature], which returns the detailed attribute information of Node regarding the given "feature" key.
(3) NodeDegree[Node, neighbor_type], which calculates the number of "neighbor_type" neighbors of the node Node in the graph.
(4) NeighbourCheck[Node, neighbor_type], which lists the "neighbor_type" neighbours of the node Node in the graph and returns them.
You may take as many steps as necessary.
Definition of the graph: There are two types of nodes in the graph: item and brand.
Item nodes have features: title, description, price, img, category. Brand nodes have features: name.
Item nodes are linked to their brand nodes, also_viewed_item nodes, buy_after_viewing_item nodes, also_bought_item nodes, bought_together_item nodes. Brand nodes are linked to their item nodes.
Question: How many co-viewed items does item Microsoft Excel VBA Professional Projects have? Please answer by providing node main feature (e.g., names) rather than node IDs. 
Thought 1: Thought 1: The question is asking about "co-viewed items" for the item "Microsoft Excel VBA Professional Projects". Based on the graph definition, "co-viewed" likely refers to "also_viewed_item" relationships. I need to find this item node first.
Action 1: RetrieveNode[Microsoft Excel VBA Professional Projects]
Observation 1: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_113.
Thought 2: Thought 2: The observation returned "brand_113" as the node ID, which seems unusual since we're looking for an item node, not a brand node. Let me double-check the retrieval. The item title might need to be more precise, or perhaps there's a mismatch. I should try to retrieve the node with the exact title.
Action 2: RetrieveNode[Microsoft Excel VBA Professional Projects]
Observation 2: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_113.
Thought 3: Thought 3: The retrieval is consistently returning a brand node (brand_113) instead of an item node. This suggests that the item title might not match exactly in the graph. I should try to find the item node by searching with keywords or consider that the title might be slightly different. Let me try to retrieve with a partial keyword or think of alternative approaches.
Action 3: Thought 3: Since retrieving the full title returns a brand node, I should try to retrieve the item node using a more specific or partial keyword. Perhaps the title in the graph is slightly different. I'll try "Microsoft Excel VBA" as a keyword to find related item nodes.
Observation 3: 
Thought 4: Thought 4: I need to adjust my approach. Since retrieving the full title returns a brand node, I should try a different keyword that might match the item node better. Let me try "Excel VBA Professional Projects" or similar variations to find the correct item node.
Action 4: Action 4: RetrieveNode[Excel VBA Professional Projects]
Observation 4: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_113.
Thought 5: Thought 5: This is still returning a brand node. Perhaps the item title is stored differently in the graph. I should try to find the item by searching for "Microsoft Excel" first and then narrow it down, or consider that this might be a brand name rather than an item title. Let me try to retrieve nodes with "Microsoft Excel" to see what comes up.
Action 5: Action 5: RetrieveNode[Microsoft Excel]
Observation 5: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_762.
Thought 6: Thought 6: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item. This suggests that "Microsoft Excel VBA Professional Projects" might actually be a brand name rather than an item title in this graph. Let me check the features of the brand_113 node to confirm if this is indeed the brand we're looking for.
Action 6: Action 6: NodeFeature[brand_113, name]
Observation 6: The name feature of brand_113 are: Independent Feature Project. 
Thought 7: Thought 7: The observation shows that brand_113 has the name "Independent Feature Project", which doesn't match "Microsoft Excel VBA Professional Projects". This confirms that my retrieval attempts are not finding the correct item node. I need to try a different approach. Perhaps the item title is stored differently in the graph. Let me try to search with "VBA Professional Projects" or other variations to find the actual item node.
Action 7: Action 7: RetrieveNode[VBA Professional Projects]
Observation 7: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_113.
Thought 8: Thought 8: I'm still getting brand_113 when trying different variations. This suggests that the item might not be directly retrievable with these keywords, or perhaps the title is stored differently. Since the question is about "co-viewed items" which corresponds to "also_viewed_item" relationships, I should try to find the item node by looking for items that might have this title or similar. Alternatively, I could try to find all item nodes and then filter by title, but that might not be efficient. Let me try a different approach: search for "Excel VBA" to see if any items come up.
Action 8: Action 8: RetrieveNode[Excel VBA]
Observation 8: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_348.
Thought 9: Thought 9: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying various keywords. This suggests that the item "Microsoft Excel VBA Professional Projects" might not exist in the graph with that exact title, or I need to approach this differently. Since the question asks about "co-viewed items" which corresponds to "also_viewed_item" relationships, I should try to find if there's an item with a similar title. Let me try to search for "Professional Projects" to see if any items match.
Action 9: Action 9: RetrieveNode[Professional Projects]
Observation 9: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_113.
Thought 10: Thought 10: I'm consistently getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve the item, which suggests that "Microsoft Excel VBA Professional Projects" might not be an item title in this graph. However, the question specifically asks about an item, so I need to find the correct item node. Let me try a different approach - perhaps the title is stored differently. I'll try searching for "Microsoft Excel" as an item title to see if there are any related items.
Action 10: Action 10: RetrieveNode[Microsoft Excel]
Observation 10: The ID of this retrieval target node is brand_762.
Thought 11: Thought 11: I'm still getting brand nodes when trying to retrieve items. This suggests that the item "Microsoft Excel VBA Professional Projects" might not exist in the graph with that exact title. However, since the question specifically asks about this item, I should try a different approach. Perhaps the title in the graph is slightly different. Let me try searching for "Excel VBA" as an item title, or consider that this might be a book or software product that could be categorized differently.
