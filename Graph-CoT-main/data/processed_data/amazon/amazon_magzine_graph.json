                    "Literary, brainy, and left-leaning, <i>Harper's Magazine</i> is an American institution (the first issue was dated June 1850). Its clean, type-heavy design shouts \"serious readers only\": many pages are two columns of text, period, and the illustrations are mostly art (often photographic) and artistic adornments. The reading, though, is what matters. It's substantive and often sublime. Along with lengthy, thoughtful, frequently controversial articles on politics and culture, you'll find essays, short fiction, in-depth reporting, and a few book reviews. Bylines routinely represent leading writers and thinkers of the day. Standing features include the much-copied but rarely equaled \"Harper's Index,\" in which statistics tell stories; \"Readings,\" a section of excerpts ranging in length from a few lines to thousands of words; and \"Annotation,\" in which a real-life document is reproduced and \"explained,\" usually to devastating political or cultural effect. Each issue is a full meal for the mind. <i>--Nicholas H. Allison</i>",

                    "The \"GQ look\" is synonymous with classic cool and sophistication, and despite a recent outburst of trendy magazines (think <i><a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NIPP/${0}\">Maxim</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000066B5I/${0}\">FHM</a></i>) vying for the attention of young professional males, the steeped-in-tradition monthly <i>GQ</i> carries on without missing a beat. Yes, there's more dcolletage gracing the cover than there used to be, but <i>GQ</i> continues to supply enough cultural commentary, celebrity profiles, features, and style guides to keep the modern man in touch with what's going on in the world from month to month.",
                    "<i>GQ</i>'s ideal reader is probably one who actually might be able to afford any of the high-end suits, shoes, and watches featured among the countless ads packed between the covers. Though the average reader might enjoy scanning a fashion spread about steakhouses entitled \"How to Dress for a Porterhouse\" and reading articles like \"50 Ways to Blow Your Bonus,\" it's unlikely that such folly holds much practical advice. Literary editor Walter Kirn keeps short fiction on display, and Alan Richman's writing on food and dining out is always entertaining, even when he comes across as borderline cranky. Two regular Q&amp;A features, \"The Style Guy\" and \"Dr. Sooth,\" run the gamut from when it's appropriate to wear a straw hat to problems in the bedroom.<br /><i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i>",

So its design must always be accessible and inviting. That said, todays average consumer is profoundly more visually sophisticated than she was a generation ago, and <i>Glamour</i> is happily rising to a new challenge: to give its inclusive approach a bold twenty-first-century edge. <br clear= \"all\"><br> <strong><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=\"cc6600\">Comparisons to Other Magazines:</font></strong> <br> Every month <i>Glamour</i> informs, inspires and entertains. The magazine's friendly voice and feel-good approach to women's looks, body, love life--their everything--is unique in the field of magazines.

                    "Priding itself on its reputation as the ultimate guide for guys, Maxim magazine offers readers an irreverent take on the passions and pursuits of the millennial male. Written with a tongue-in-cheek vibe, the magazine manages to inject humor into the most serious of topics, even as it educates and informs. From glossy shots of bikini-clad beauties and candid interviews with the hottest starlets in Hollywood to in-depth analyses of controversial topics and biting features on true crime stories, each issue is full of testosterone-driven fun. <br /><br /> Maxim magazine is not your father's men's magazine. Its snarky tone and sarcastic wit offer a satirical take on every imaginable topic, such as pop culture, politics, love, and war. The question and answer column often provides hilarious advice with little real-world value, while humor columns give you jokes to share with your buddies at the water cooler or your next poker game. With a wink and a nudge, the unique style of this publication distinguishes it from others of its kind. <br /><br /> With a finger to the pulse of what's important to the modern male, Maxim magazine dedicates lots of room to exploring the latest trends. Within its pages, you'll find reviews of the newest video games, helping you separate the truth from the hype. Sports enthusiasts will appreciate its suggestions for everything from snowboards to climbing gear, while its unpretentious recommendations of the latest fashions provide easy ways to enhance your personal style. <br /><br /> With its cheeky tone and flippant treatment of serious subjects, a subscription to Maxim magazine gives you an alternative take on the world around you.",

A pioneer in the fashion magazine field, it provides women who are passionate about shopping with a broad range of the best styles and products out there--but a tight edit of the pieces that are worth a second look. As the voice of a friend in the know, <em>Lucky</em> makes fashion and beauty fun and accessible for everyone, showcasing what to wear and how to wear it.  <br /><br /> The magazine features gorgeous photography and an endless array of product shots--and every item comes with how-to-get it-right-now information next to its photo (pricing, website, phone number, store location). Readers don&rsquo;t have to flip to the back of the book to read the fine print on how much something costs--and they can buy it right then and there. It&rsquo;s all about instant gratification. <em>Lucky</em> also shows readers a variety of price points&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see a pair of $300 shoes next to a $30 pair. <br /><br /> <em>Lucky</em>&rsquo;s editors offer real-life women advice on how to wear the latest trends in a way that&rsquo;s flattering and right for their shape and size: they don&rsquo;t assume one size or trend fits all. It&rsquo;s all about accessibility, and remembering that fashion is supposed to be fun, not stressful.    There&rsquo;s also advice on how to \"shop your own closet\": you don&rsquo;t need to go out and buy a whole new wardrobe each season&mdash;just a few key pieces and styling tricks can turn a summer piece into a fall one. <br /><br /> Since <em>Lucky</em>&rsquo;s launch in December 2000, circulation has rocketed from 500,000 to over 1.1 million, proving to be one of the most successful launches in Conde Nast history.   <br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc6600;\"><em></em></span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc6600;\">What You Can Expect in Each Issue:</span></strong>  <table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"400\"> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/a-plus/Lucky-L-08.jpg\"><img alt=\"A Month of Outfits\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/a-plus/Lucky-S-08.jpg\" /></a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>"

More than just a how-to hunting and fishing handbook, Gray's provides the reader with a deep personal satisfaction of the sporting experience through its absorbing literature, exciting photographic essays and fine sporting and wildlife art. Published 7 times per year.",
                    "<I>Gray's Sporting Journal</I> is one of the hidden gems of sporting and wildlife magazines. Consider the publication values: photographic essays (on drift boating, for example, or trap shooting in Europe) are part of every issue and are always very well done; the pages are glossy, thick and substantial; there's art (usually a painting) in the back of each issue; you'll often find a poem tucked away in its 150-plus pages; and there are fewer advertisements here than you'll see in a <I><a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005N7Q5/${0}\">Field & Stream</a></I>. But what makes it most difficult to send an issue to the recycling bin is the writing, which is of a depth, breadth, and quality that you will be hard-pressed to find in any other outdoor magazine. The source of this writing helps to account for its value--specifically, it comes from all corners, including university professors who find meaning in the outdoors and their interaction with it, and people who were obviously hunting and fishing long before many people were born. But no matter whether the story you're reading seems to emanate from a campfire or a classroom, the writing itself is almost always engaging. Some will find that the combination of high art and the advertisements for exclusive game ranches makes the publication feel too much like you're sipping cognac in a leather chair in your library. The writing, however, is never so stuffy, and stays firmly rooted to the outdoors that inspire it."

                    "\"Like <I>Maxim</I>, but about Xbox!\" was clearly the mandate given to Mike Salmon, former editor-in-chief of <I>PC Accelerator</I> and current editor-in-chief of <I>The Official Xbox Magazine</I>. He got it half right: this gamer lifestyle magazine has the locker-room feel of <I>Maxim</I> but lacks <I>Maxim</I>'s intelligent, tongue-in-cheek style. The result is something that looks like it was written by high-school sophomores. For example, a bio of Kasumi, a character in the game <I>Dead or Alive 3</I>, reads \"A redhead with a difference--she can take on all comers. And if <I>DoA 3</I> has the \"[breast] bounce on/off\" option, she'll definitely have a lot of comers.\" On the plus side, the game reviews and previews are informative and mostly free of bull. <I>--Mike Fehlauer</I>"

                    "American Girl magazine is an appropriate, entertaining, and informative magazine for girls over eight years old.

                    "Published since 1913 by Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society, American Scientist is an award-winning magazine written by scientists for those curious about science and engineering.",
                    "When you're looking for well-researched content chronicling the latest developments in science and technology, American Scientist magazine delivers. Each issue covers a wide range of scientific topics, including recent research developments in biology, chemistry, psychology, physics, geology, and technology. <br /><br /> All of the articles in American Scientist magazine are written by scientists and engineers, and the magazine is published by Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society, so you can trust the veracity of the content. The photographs, charts, and diagrams that accompany articles make the subjects accessible even to those with little familiarity with the given topic and add depth to the knowledge of those familiar with the material. However, the majority of the content is aimed at those with a background in general science, so readers with little scientific training may find the articles a bit technical. <br /><br /> Regular columns in American Scientist magazine highlight modern scientists' diverse viewpoints regarding the process of science. Personal essays on the intersection of science and computing, cutting-edge and controversial science, and the future of scientific research allow you a glimpse into the minds of people actively working in the field. Book reviews help you narrow down your reading list, while insightful cartoons keep you smiling even on days when your own research isn't living up to your expectations. <br /><br /> Whether you are a professional scientist interested in keeping up with discoveries in different fields or a student who simply likes to explore the world in greater depth, American Scientist magazine can give you a greater appreciation for modern science and technology."

From little-known events to major incidents, historic moments from multiple eras grace the pages of each issue. Whether you are an avid history buff or simply someone who enjoys dipping into the fascinating details of historic events, History Magazine has something for you. <br /><br /> War and exploration are common themes in History Magazine, but you can also find in-depth articles on art, innovation, sports, crime, and daily life in a historical context. While the magazine mainly focuses on western history and places a heavy emphasis on North American history in particular, other places around the globe are also represented. Expect to learn interesting tidbits about every era from ancient Rome to the early 20th century. <br /><br /> Instead of focusing on one specific time period each issue, the magazine offers ten to fifteen articles on different historical topics, so you gain new insights into multiple events, people, or incidents each time you sit down to read. The writing is engaging enough to make even oft-overlooked topics fascinating, and the maps and archival images help bring historical details to life. <br /><br /> Whether you are interested in building up a knowledge base about history that will serve you well in trivia contests with friends or want to learn more about the people and places that have shaped modern civilization, a subscription to History Magazine provides hours of entertainment and education that will inspire you to look at the modern world in an entirely new way."

                    "Sold each week both separately and as part of the <i>Sunday New York Times</i>, the <i>Book Review</i> divides the published world into two parts for easy consumption: nonfiction, and fiction and poetry. There is no attempt to be comprehensive. Although scholarly books are regularly reviewed, the sort of thing chosen is likely to be no more arcane than a cultural history of Halloween or a new biography of Jesse James, along with, say, the memoirs of David Rockefeller. The reader of the <i>Book Review</i> can also expect to find the latest novel by <a href=\"/exec/obidos/author=Oates%2c%20Carol%2c%20Joyce/${0}\">Joyce Carol Oates</a> or <a href=\"/exec/obidos/author=Conroy%2c%20Pat/${0}\">Pat Conroy</a> as well as the efforts of one or two first novelists and the new book of poems by <a href=\"/exec/obidos/author=Collins%2c%20Billy/${0}\">Billy Collins</a>. What distinguishes the reviews from those of your hometown Sunday newspaper are principally three things: there are more of them (each issue runs some 20 pages), they are likely to be more searching and more critical (often the reviewers are at least as well-known as the authors reviewed), and each review has behind it the authority of the <i><a href=\"/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007B02I/${0}\">New York Times</a></i> itself, whose cultural as well as political clout is simply unmatched in American life. For a book to sell, it doesnt necessarily have to be considered in the <i>Book Review</i>. For a book to be taken seriously, it probably does--and readers who take themselves seriously invariably read the <i>Book Review</i>. <i>--Terry Caesar</i>",

                    "The New York Review of Books has served as a forum for writers and thinkers to discuss not only current books but also the provocative and complex issues of American culture, society, economics, politics, and the arts.",
                    "If all book reviews aspire to the condition of magazines, the <I>New York Review</I> would represent the best realization of this aspiration to date. It retains the character of a book review, published 20 times a year. But since its inception over 30 years ago, the reviews have been long, dense (recent years have brought the practice of footnotes), and learned. Significant fiction is pondered, along with bits of poetry, slices of science, and gobs of political science, history, economics, biography, art, and music. The reader of the <I>New York Review</I> easily feels relieved of the cultural burden of having to read a book once having completed the sufficient burden of having read a thorough review of it. Although the impeccably left-leaning editors would be loathe to agree, only major figures or discourses in the European intellectual tradition need apply to their pages for consideration. Hence, for example, although occasional \"pieces\" on certain worthy movies now appear, popular culture is not a serious concern. Lately, the <I>Review</I> has given over more of its pages (from 60 to 80 each issue) to journalistic reports--the latest political currents in China or Russia, the state of affairs in Kurdistan or at Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay. Its core identity remains, however, that of a magazine unequaled for addressing intellectual \"issues\"--Darwin under attack again, pedophilia continuing in the Church, whither globalization--through reviewing them as these issues appear in book form. <I>--Terry Caesar</I>"

                    "For the record: Mental Floss magazine is an intelligent read, but not too intelligent. We're the sort of intelligent that you hang out with for a while, enjoy our company, laugh a little, smile a lot and then we part ways. Great times. And you only realize how much you learned from us after a little while. Like a couple days later when you're impressing your friends with all these intriguing facts and things you picked up from us, and they ask you how you know so much, and you think back on that great afternoon you spent with us and you smile.",

While many men's magazines focus on slick centerfolds, this magazine takes the opposite route. Each issue is filled with readers' stories that run the gamut from romantic to raunchy, but all share a common theme; they focus on stimulating the mind as well as the body. This dedication to erotica as an art form makes the stories appealing to both men and women, with many couples enjoying the magazine together. <br /><br /> From nostalgic stories about first time experiences to tales of mysterious one-time encounters, Penthouse Letters magazine offers something to titillate most everyone. No aspect of consensual adult sexuality goes unexplored within its covers, with kinky BDSM stories printed alongside tales of sensual seduction. While there's no traditional centerfold, the stories themselves are illustrated with tasteful photography, adding to the visual and erotic appeal of the publication. <br /><br /> Readers are invited to share their own confessions with guaranteed anonymity. Have you ever had one of those too good to be true adventures that you couldn't tell anyone about? So have many others, and they share those experiences freely between the covers of Penthouse Letters magazine. No matter your fantasy or preference, the stories are always tasteful and arousing, giving you a peek into the bedrooms of others, which just might spice up your own erotic life. <br /><br /> A subscription to Penthouse Letters magazine provides you with a sexy, savvy, smart way to explore your fantasies, so you can enjoy your intimate moments to the fullest.",

In each quarterly issue, <i>The Fretboard Journal</i> celebrates the innovators of the music world and the tools they use, acoustic and electric, weird and collectible. You'll find famous musicians interviewing other famous musicians about the equipment they use; profiles of some of the world's finest luthiers; and great essays covering the historical context of legendary recordings. With original photography, archival quality paper, and minimal advertising, each issue will be a keepsake you'll cherish. Unlike most guitar magazines, <i>The Fretboard Journal</i> doesn't review gear or feature instructional pieces; it simply covers the great stories behind musical instruments and musicians. Whether your interest is old-time music or indie rock (or somewhere in between), you'll find something in each eclectic issue specifically for you."

Its readers look to the magazine for authoritative background on homes of all architectural stylesfrom the earliest, Colonial-era houses, to Queen Annes and Craftsmans, to houses built in the mid- to late-1950s (anything 50 years or older is covered). <i>OHJ</i> is published 6 times a year, and gives readers the education, resources, tips, and inspiration to tackle and enjoy every step of the restoration process. <i>OHJ</i>s readers look forward to a mix of topics in each issue, from historical overviews, expert how-tos, and first-person restorer experiences, to technical articles offering a wealth of background and advice, to product reviews. Whether restoring an old house is a dream or a reality, many <i>OHJ</i> readers hold on to each issue to refer to again and again.<br><br> <i>OHJ</i> began 35 years ago as a grassroots, reader-generated publication, and is still open to contributions from its readers. These can include Old-House Living pieces as well as problem-solving articles. One recent example profiled a readers decision to install a farmhouse-style sink in her turn-of-the-century Long Island kitchen, and the challenges she faced in making it happen. <br clear=\"all\"> <br> <strong><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=\"cc6600\">What You Can Expect in Each Issue:</font></strong> <br><ul> <li><b>About the House:</b> Up-to-date information on the latest events that old house enthusiasts wont want to miss (conferences, home tours, exhibits) as well as a look at old-house related topics in the news, helpful resources for homeowners, book reviews, and a timely maintenance tip. <li><b>Ask <i>OHJ</i>:</b> Editors and expert contributors answer old-house related questions submitted by readers. <li><b>Historic Properties (formerly Swaps & Sales):</b> A marketplace for old houses around the country, filled with color photos and descriptions. <li><b>Historic Retreats:</b> A visit to a historic building that highlights the architectural significance of the destination. <li><b>Old-House Insider:</b> A photographic tour of a professionally restored house with text that outlines the techniques and products used to make it happen (includes a breakout section of products and resources). <li><b>Old-House Living:</b> The longest-running section; a profile of an old-house restorer, and the personal story of their house project. <li><b>Old-House Toolbox:</b> One of the magazines experts reviews a tool essential for a specific old-house repair, and offers tips for buying the right one. <li><b>Period Products:</b> The latest in contemporary products that are either exact reproductions or interpretations faithful to a specific architectural style or theory. <li><b>Remuddling:</b> A tongue-in-cheek look at a house thats been remodeled with no attention paid to matching the updates to the original architecture (aka the old-house equivalent of Glamours Fashion Donts). <li><b>Features:</b> Each issue contains a mix of articles, including how tos (in-depth lessons on restoring old-house details); historical overviews (a look at how and why certain old-house features came into being); technical stories (a broad look at a subjectlike energy efficiency, or bat-proofing a housethat offers readers a starting point for doing it themselves); style articles (an in-depth look at a particular architectural style) and restorer stories (a personal look at one familys restoration project). For example, the April issue featured an informative, photogenic article on decorative Victorian-era shingle patterns; stucco repair at a historic mansion; an in-depth lesson on using epoxy glues; a historical and visually rich overview of clay tile roofs, including a list of maintenance tips; an architectural perspective on Ranch houses; a how-to on repairing soffits; and a profile of a Chicago couple that saved a mid-century house from the wrecking ball. </ul> <strong><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=\"cc6600\">Past Issues:</font></strong><br> <table cellpadding=\"4\" border=\"0\" width=\"95%\" cellspacing=\"4\"> <tr class=\"tiny\" valign=\"top\" align=\"center\"> <td> <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000CQNKB8.01.PT01.MXXXXXXX.jpg\"> </td> <td> <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000CQNKB8.01.PT02.MXXXXXXX.jpg\"> </td> <td> <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000CQNKB8.01.PT03.MXXXXXXX.jpg\"> </td> <td> <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000CQNKB8.01.PT04.MXXXXXXX.jpg\"> </td> <td> <img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000CQNKB8.01.PT05.MXXXXXXX.jpg\"> </td> <td> <img border=\"0\" src=\" https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/B000CQNKB8.01.PT06.MXXXXXXX.jpg\"> </td> </tr> </table> <br> <strong><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=\"cc6600\">Contributors:</font></strong><br> The stable of regular contributors consists of top experts in the field of restoration and old-home maintenance.

People who are interested in fine craftsmanship and details, antiques and original home features, people who are preservation-minded, and old-house owners who want to do right by their home (make repairs with an eye towards maintaining their houses architectural integrity) will get the most out of this magazine. In terms of the competition, <i>OHJ</i> offers quality editorial from an impressive roster of experts, all of which is focused on maintaining the authenticity of older buildings (they dont rip out and discard radiators in this magazine). <i>OHJ</i> is the only magazine that offers a package of ideas, inspiration, support, and nuts-and-bolts how-to information to help readers outfit their older homes in period-perfect style, both inside and out. The <i>New York Times</i> has referred to <i>OHJ</i> time and again as \"the bible of old-house restoration.\" <br clear= \"all\"><br> <strong><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\" color=\"cc6600\">Advertising:</font></strong> <br> Advertisements are almost exclusively for building and restoration materials such as doors, paints, tiles, appliances, reproduction lighting, wallpapers, and furniture.

                    "<i><i>Acres U.S.A.</i></i> is the national magazine of organic and sustainable farming. In continuous publication for over 35 years, <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> reaches more commercial-scale organic and sustainable farmers than any other publication in North America.",
                    "Begun in 1970, when there were merely a few lone souls practicing eco-agriculture, farming that is both economical and ecological, <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> founder and executive editor Charles Walters recognized how the methodical cheating of small farmers and the enforced swing toward new, chemical agriculture were gears in the same machine, working in tandem to transform the countryside -- and not for the better. Corporate power and public policy were colluding in the destruction of the family farm, and the process of annihilation was gathering speed. Walters met, interviewed and presented to the public the works of soil scientists, farmers, economic thinkers and farm policy experts who were gradually being pushed aside by mainstream publications in favor of more modern, and more toxic, solutions. He worked tirelessly to reveal the inadequacies of chemical farming, and promoted gently coaxing nature into yielding her bounty.",
                    "Decades later, <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> readers continue to receive the latest news and in-depth analyses of ecological agriculture technologies, economic issues and environmental news each month. They meet successful eco-farmers through case reports. Top figures in eco-agriculture share their stories, struggles and successes through the <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> Interview. And eco-agriculture is brought full-circle through countless discussions of complex veterinary and human health and healing issues. Add in regular columns on marketing, grazing, tillage methods, soils, weed and insect control, high-value crops, news from around the world, meetings, and more, and youll begin to understand the scope of what <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> offers.",
                    "Based on the work of scientists and farmers whose sophisticated approach to agriculture reveals chemical farming as obsolete and misguided, <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> teaches readers how to embrace the science of nature. Rather than batter nature into submission with bizarre chemistry that short-circuits natural processes, sustainable farmers feed the soil and bring it into balance. Subsequently, they are rewarded with superior crops and lower input costs. <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> has helped thousands of farmers feed the nation's growing appetite for clean, delicious food and showed them how to make a profit while they're at it.",
                    "<i>Acres U.S.A.</i> holds a unique understanding of and role in the eco-agriculture movement, introducing readers to the experts who are putting both new practices and proven methods to work in the field. Were not reporting on trends from afar; our writers are experts in their field, providing high-level, useful information for serious farmers.",
                    "<i>Acres U.S.A.</i> is independent of government, Extension, the universities, agribusiness and the agrichemical industry. Were a family-owned business and an outspoken authority on eco-farming, unfettered from any outside interests. We aim for comprehensive coverage of the multitude of issues within the vast field of farming.",
                    "Learn from the oldest and largest magazine focusing on sustainable agriculture, emphasizing practical, soils up advice for sophisticated, innovative farmers. Leading the movement toward chemical-free agriculture for over 35 years, our readers rely on <i>Acres U.S.A.</i> for the latest techniques for growing bountiful, nutritious crops and raising healthy, vibrant livestock.",

Plus pictorials of the most beautiful women in the world.",
                    "Penthouse magazine has entertained and delighted men since 1965 with its pictures of beautiful, scantily-clad (if at all) women and hot sex articles. In the 1990s, it went through a change to a harder-core format, but since 2005 has come back to its roots of soft-core pornography and erotica. <br /><br /> Columns in Penthouse magazine feature lots of sexually-explicit content and pictures of women designed to delight men. The famous Penthouse Forum, which publishes explicit letters from readers, is still a monthly feature. Several explicit pictorials run every month, some focusing on a specific model and others featuring several models around a theme like women with all-natural bodies or women from the military. A centerfold and accompanying pictorial features that month's Penthouse Pet. Other articles include interviews with Penthouse Pets, longer articles about sex-themed topics like sex museums and the BDSM world, and sexual adventure stories. <br /><br /> Penthouse magazine is not all about sex, though. Men will also find technology and fashion well-covered throughout each month's issue. Buying guides help you find the best electronics, toys, and man-themed gifts. Full Frontal, a monthly featured column, covers entertainment including gaming, movies, and DVDs. Other male indulgences like great scotch or premium cigars are frequent topics of discussion, as are hunting, fast cars, and sports. <br /><br /> Ultimately, Penthouse magazine is designed for men who aren't afraid to be men. Now that the magazine has come back to the great soft-core sex content that has always been its strength, it's time to take another look."

This venerable publication has long been known for its frequent celebrity centerfolds, adult humor, and a surprising number of outstanding fiction writers and columnists. <br /><br /> Playboy magazine is a celebration of the male world. You'll find beautiful women, dressed and undressed, throughout the book, along with the famous centerfold, a fold-out full-body naked celebration of the Playmate of the Month model. Even the photographers of these lovely ladies are often people of fame and notoriety, like Annie Liebovitz and Bunny Yeager, the original Betty Page photographer. <br /><br /> Playboy has also long been known for its outstanding monthly interviews with people like Jack Nicholson, President Jimmy Carter, and Martin Luther King. It's also known for its discovery of dozens of talented writers. Alex Haley, for instance, once served as a Playboy interviewer, and some of Steven King's earliest works graced pages only a few flips away from the centerfold. <br /><br /> Playboy magazine serves as a cultural guide for men as well. Fashion, food, vacation spots, and the best in spirits and smokes are all discussed in columns and features every month. You'll also find great and often irreverent guides to movies and entertainment. Playboy magazine is a fun exploration of everything that makes up a man's world, and a subscription will ensure you never miss an issue.",

                    "If you need some help with creative stories for your young child, Ladybug Magazine is an excellent solution. Each issue is a compilation of stories, poems, and whimsical illustrations that will keep your child entertained just before bed or any other time a good story is in order. <br /><br /> Each issue of Ladybug Magazine contains several full-length stories that are short enough to keep a young child's attention but long enough to tell a complete tale. The topics and tone of each story are geared for the three- to six-year-old mind, so the adult reader doesn't have to explain much. The unique stories can, however, kick off conversations in which the whole family can participate. <br /><br /> Between the stories are short, fun little poems that are illustrated in their own way. Read about animals, insects, kids, imaginary creatures, and more in these short interludes between tales. Some of them are short enough for a child to memorize after a few rounds of rereading. <br /><br /> The read-along factor is the most important part of Ladybug Magazine. Each story has Large Print and easy words, so early learners can follow along. Some eager new readers may even be able to read a few poems or stories themselves, especially if an adult is available to guide them through the print. The pictures serve as great cues to help along the way. <br /><br /> Subscribing to Ladybug Magazine is a great way to find something new and exciting to read together with your young child. Let the pages of Ladybug help you introduce your child to the wonderful world of literature."

Each issue is themed around a specific animal or group of animals, discussing habits and habitat in depth so the reader gains a thorough understanding. Best of all, this magazine is refreshingly free of advertising. <br /><br /> An issue of Zoobooks Magazine has about 24 pages. Most of the magazine is packed with colorful pictures and illustrations of the theme animal, as well as short articles and fact sidebars. The most unique features of each animal are broken down and explained at a child's level. For species that are extinct or becoming extinct, children are encouraged to take action to ensure those animals' futures. The last four pages of each edition offer a pull-out activity booklet filled with games, puzzles, and coloring pages. <br /><br /> Zoobooks Magazine started as a product parents could purchase at kiosks near zoo exhibits appropriate to the specific issue. Demand for complete sets of Zoobooks quickly grew, and Wildlife Education Ltd. began selling subscriptions. Today, Zoobooks Magazine subscriptions also include monthly access to the online Secret Jungle, where kids can print out more animal-themed activities and play online games. Here, kids can also participate in a bi-weekly eSafari, in which subscribers can take a guided tour of great online animal sites and learn more about the particular month's theme animal. <br /><br /> Zoobooks Magazine offers a fantastic way for parents to answer all those animal questions inspired by zoo visits. Many budding zoologists save every issue, building a collection they can refer to for years to come."

A pioneer in the fashion magazine field, it provides women who are passionate about shopping with a broad range of the best styles and products out there--but a tight edit of the pieces that are worth a second look. As the voice of a friend in the know, <em>Lucky</em> makes fashion and beauty fun and accessible for everyone, showcasing what to wear and how to wear it.  <br /><br /> The magazine features gorgeous photography and an endless array of product shots--and every item comes with how-to-get it-right-now information next to its photo (pricing, website, phone number, store location). Readers don&rsquo;t have to flip to the back of the book to read the fine print on how much something costs--and they can buy it right then and there. It&rsquo;s all about instant gratification. <em>Lucky</em> also shows readers a variety of price points&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see a pair of $300 shoes next to a $30 pair. <br /><br /> <em>Lucky</em>&rsquo;s editors offer real-life women advice on how to wear the latest trends in a way that&rsquo;s flattering and right for their shape and size: they don&rsquo;t assume one size or trend fits all. It&rsquo;s all about accessibility, and remembering that fashion is supposed to be fun, not stressful.    There&rsquo;s also advice on how to \"shop your own closet\": you don&rsquo;t need to go out and buy a whole new wardrobe each season&mdash;just a few key pieces and styling tricks can turn a summer piece into a fall one. <br /><br /> Since <em>Lucky</em>&rsquo;s launch in December 2000, circulation has rocketed from 500,000 to over 1.1 million, proving to be one of the most successful launches in Conde Nast history.   <br /><br /><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc6600;\"><em></em></span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc6600;\">What You Can Expect in Each Issue:</span></strong>  <table align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"3\" width=\"400\"> <tbody> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/a-plus/Lucky-L-08.jpg\"><img alt=\"A Month of Outfits\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/a-plus/Lucky-S-08.jpg\" /></a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>"

A rocky decade ensued, but <i>The New Yorker</i> is now back at the top of its game under David Remnick's editorship. Each issue offers commentaries and reporting on politics, culture, and events, with a focus that's both national and international; humor and cartoons; fiction and poetry; and reviews of books, movies, theater, music, art, and fashion. Several times a year special issues focus on a theme--music, fashion, business. The writing is mostly first-rate, frequently coming from top literary and journalistic talents. <i>The New Yorker</i>'s weekly issues can seem overwhelming--so much good stuff to read, piling up so fast!--but it's as easy to dip in for a small snack as it is to wade in for a substantial meal.<i> --Nicholas H. Allison</i>"

In 1987 it was on only its second editor when management decided to shake things up. A rocky decade ensued, but <i>The New Yorker</i> is now back at the top of its game under David Remnick's editorship. Each issue offers commentaries and reporting on politics, culture, and events, with a focus that's both national and international; humor and cartoons; fiction and poetry; and reviews of books, movies, theater, music, art, and fashion. Several times a year special issues focus on a theme--music, fashion, business. The writing is mostly first-rate, frequently coming from top literary and journalistic talents. <i>The New Yorker</i>'s weekly issues can seem overwhelming--so much good stuff to read, piling up so fast!--but it's as easy to dip in for a small snack as it is to wade in for a substantial meal.<i> --Nicholas H. Allison</i>"

Started in 1925, the publication has yet to disappoint readers with substandard short stories or essay content. Despite having a heavy focus on the New York life scene, there is so much included on general arts and life that readers from all over the world continue to enjoy the magazine.",
                    "The New Yorker magazine is famous for its covers, normally created by a popular political cartoonist. These covers have made waves in the publishing world, as well as had a tremendous influence on art. None can say this as much as the Saul Steinberg illustration for the March 29, 1976, edition. Called View of the World from 9th Avenue, the drawing focuses strictly on a few blocks in Manhattan, with the rest of the world an afterthought.",

The character was created specifically for the first cover and evolved into a mascot for the magazine. Eustace was based on the cartoonish image of Count d'Orsay found in the Encyclop&#xE6;dia Britannica's 11th edition.",
                    "The New Yorker magazine has had a hand in bringing many popular movies to the big screen. Based on short stories, essays, and articles that have run throughout the pages, dozens of blockbuster and award-winning films have garnered attention by being featured in the magazine. These include The Hours, Adaptation, Angela's Ashes, Boys Don't Cry, In Cold Blood, and The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.",
